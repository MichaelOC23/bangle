continues through the engineering phase and, upon launch,
generates recurring revenue through ongoing platform
subscriptions and managed services

— Industry consolidation drove the acquisitions of three clients (each
acquired by existing Fincentric clients), resulting in increased downsell
— One asset management client is in the process of insourcing its
marketing solution by the beginning of 2025 and is gradually reducing

Mpportunity  
Y Clients are increasingly relying on third-party providers to
solve ongoing complexities with data, integration and
platform bugs, creating “stickiness” and willingness to
pay a premium for the highest quality service  
Y Clients are looking for simplified service models that are
more subscription in nature to improve efficiency and
scalability (without having to draft a new contract each
time for FTE driven work)  
Benefits  
v Transition to subscription-based managed services
model from FTE-dependent retainers allows for more
flexible staffing at a lower cost  
v Provides higher quality recurring revenue tied to
subscriptions rather than FTEs  
v Separate platform fee provides higher base recurring
revenue (some clients had historically pared back on FTE
contracts while keeping the same platform subscription
services)  
v Annual in-contract-term price escalators are easier to
enforce than price escalation clauses at contract  
renewal

Specialization in Data  
Fincentric’” Source: Oliver Wyman  
Perspectives on Core Competitors  
Dataeetgnostic front-office providers develop highly or fully customizable
frdgrtoffice solutions, in addition to offering data aggregation and
formalization capabilities, most closely mirroring Fincentric’s offerings  
Consulting firms provide UI / UX services and will focus on developing
custom front-office solutions  
These firms have low specialization in data, most often linking front-office
solutions to data back-end, occasionally providing data management
services via their parent organization (e.g., Accenture)  
Core value proposition is the provision and sourcing of data, with
aggregation and normalization of it  
Front-office customization capabilities are limited, however partnerships
with the likes of LabCl and financial.com allow for development of more
custom solutions for certain providers  
Vendors enable development of business applications via low-code / nocode platform, source & aggregate data from data providers  
Also provide framework for user interface in which third-party business
applications / widgets can be inserted, with widget vendors providing data
shown in widgets  
True out-of-the box solutions, with limited customization capabilities
following a SaaS modelat a lower price point than Fincentric

Mechanics  
* Fimeentric generates the vast majority of its revenue from  
recurring sources (82% in 2023)  
— Recurring revenue typically trails ACV, as ACV is
recognized immediately, while the corresponding
revenue is recognized over the life of the contract  
* Project-Based revenue recognized upon delivery  
Trends  
* Recurring reve  
ue has grown modestly over the last 3  
years, with additional growth in project-based work  
— Growthinre
hrough wal  
curring revenue has been driven primarily
et share increases with existing clients as a  
esult of innovations to enhance product o
capture white space  
ferings and  
— Price increases have not been a source of growth  
historically, but are expected to be in 2024  
E and 2025E  
* Pent-up demand post-Covid led to a spike in revenue in  
2022, especially related to project-based wor  
* Historically, project-based work did not necessarily result  
in future recurring revenue  
— Projects initiated after mid-2023, as a mat
include recurring revenue post launch
