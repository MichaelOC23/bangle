Advanced Charting Library (ACL)  
The Advanced Charting Library is the toolkit our developers use to build timeseries financial charts that
show how one or more securities has performedover time. Using the library, our engineers build highly
stylized chart experiences that are custom-built to client specifications.  
The ACL can be used to build charts from the simplified to the most advanced workspace tools for
technical analysis.  
Image charts  
Simple but powerful, image-based charts
work great on any platform or browser.
These charts are incredibly versatile and
are used in a wide range of scenarios.
Combining data APIs and standard
templates that allow designers to interact
with real-life examples and developers to
build to spec every time. These are ideal
for non-interactive data visualizations that
appear in web, PDF reports or email alerts.
