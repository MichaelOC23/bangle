Seamless data  
Fincentric provides’robust APIs for all types of financial data, including
structured and.unstructured.  
Our APhintegration follows the Restful JSON model and supports
manyontent scenarios. API request parameters are sent as HTTP
GET or POST requests, and the response can be returned in various
formats, including XML, JSON, JSONP and YAML.  
We supplement our APIs with documentation detailing input
parameters and expected outputs, as well as API end points and data
type schemas.  
Entitlements  
Entitlements can be applied to APIs so users can be targeted with
specific content on a request-by-request basis. We establish an
agreed-upon mechanism at the outset for authenticating and entitling
content.  
Data aggregation  
Fincentric data APIs allow you to incorporate data into modules or
pages developed and hosted by your own firm or a third party. Our
APIs provide the utmost flexibility for your design and technical teams.
