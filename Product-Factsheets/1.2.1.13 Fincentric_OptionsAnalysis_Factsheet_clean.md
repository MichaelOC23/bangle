Features
Market data Data feed*agnostic. Return full and filterable option chains with live
quote data. Users can quickly filter by expiration date and see summary
openNnterest statistics.
Extrinsic/intrinsic value Breaks down the option price into time value and how profitable the  
option would be if it were exercised today. We can also show the in-themoneyness of the option contract.  
Black-Scholes calculations Contract-level Black-Scholes calculations like implied volatility and
Greeks. We also provide a calculator where a user can adjust inputs,
to see how the option contact value could change over time or as the
underlying price changes.  
Strategy Analyses Strategy-level calculations including break even, max profit & loss, net
premium, net Greeks, probability of profit, and a P&L chart feature. These
analyses evaluate the potential risks and returns associated with a trade.  
Blended implied volatility This calculation quickly computes the implied volatility at any point
in time across strikes. It is similar to the VIX but can be applied to any
security with options.
