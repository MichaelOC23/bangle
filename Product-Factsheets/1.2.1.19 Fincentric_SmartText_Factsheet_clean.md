Breadth was mildly negative across US markets on Monday, with 3,169 advancing issues and 4,721 declining issues. The cumulative Advance/Decline line for the NYSE,
which gives a longer term view of the breadth of participation in market trends, appears to be declining in the medium term. This implies that investors have begun to rotate
