Employ targeted data analysis for any scenario  
For a quick analysis, an advisor can select
a predefined scenario, portfolio and
investment amount to create a standard
report for clients. For more advanced
analysis, users can develop specific
scenarios for contributions, withdrawals,
advisor fees and dividend reinvestment to
be applied to multiple portfolios.  
The scenarios can be saved for re-use  
on other portfolios and made accessible
to a global audience by administrators.
Hypothetical analysis can be runona
single fund or index, a portfolio of multiple
funds or any combination of them.  
Able to function across various capabilities
and integrate with other tools, Fincentric
can provide a custom user experience with
the hypo tool. Your team would define
what parameters go into the engine, what
comes out, and from there define the user
experience specific to your client.
