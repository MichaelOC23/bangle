Exhibit B  
Quote Meter Audit/Review Guidelines
This document has been developed to serve as a guideline for market data vendors that
are required to have an audit/review of their quote meter software.
+ An audit/review must be performed within the first 90 days of service by an external
audit firm acceptable to the NYSE. Thereafter, an annual audit/review is required by
an auditor acceptable to the Exchange. Broker/dealers and banks may, with) prior
approval of the Exchange, use internal audit departments to conduct their annual
quote meter audit/review so long as both the audit/review scope and its findings are
reported to the Exchange and signed by the Chief Compliance Officermof the firm.
* The audit/review should check that the quote meter is performing the following
functions:
@ Recognize and count a "quote-packet", whichSis*defined as any data
element, or all data elements, for a single issue. (For example, open, high,
low, last, volume, net change, bid, offer, sizerare data elements. "IBM" is a  
single issue.) An index value also qualifies.as an issue, such as NYA.  
@ Verify that metering of quote packets*is being done for all metered services
identified in Exhibit A. (For example, snap-quote, order entry, etc.)
Additionally, ensure that non-metéréd services are being excluded.  
+ Verify that “capping” of nofi-professionals at the non-professional rate is
being metered properly, andythat the “capped” accounts are being reported as
non-professionals and their) usage removed from the usage report.  
¢ For data disseminated‘n respect of a list of issues in a portfolio format or set
up as a market minder service, each quote packet for each issue is subject to
the fee. (For example, a portfolio with five issues translates to 5 quote
packets.)  
Verify that-the meter can count fee liable quotes according to where the
security @ primarily listed, (NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ.) not the regional
exchange where the last sale may have taken place (Philadelphia Exchange,
Pacific Stock Exchange, etc.)  
¢Confirm that the quote meter is counting fee liable quotes (i.e., less than 20
minutes old) only during NYSE market hours, currently 9:30 am through 4:20
pm, (excluding weekends and holidays.)  
+ Validate that the quote counting software is able to generate monthly reports
showing the total number of quotes accessed for each exchange, and that these
report totals are consistent with the total number of quotes counted by the
meter. The audit should also verify for any two months that the total quotes
counted by the meter is the same count as reported to NYSE.
