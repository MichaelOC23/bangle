Exhibit A - apiD Product Description  
Product Description
Telekurs apiD provides a basis for different interfaces to integrate Telekurs financial and news data into a customer application or platform.
The apiD provides access to a wide range of Telekurs Financial data, as well as a set of predefined functions and three technical
interfaces for data delivery. Benefits of apiD include:  
e All data comes from a single source and is fed in through a standard interface, which simplifies configuration and operation.  
e Thanks to a sophisticated authorization system, the data selection can be customized according to a range of different
requirements (e.g. bank clients, in-house users at various departments).  
e — Intelligent packaging of data and functions facilitates the rapid implementation of apiD-based applications.
© Open, standardized interfaces permit fast and simple programming and data integration.  
apiD offers easy access to Telekurs’ comprehensive range of data: quotes, portfolio management information, business reports and much
more. Data available includes:  
Quotes Fundamental Data/Details On: Additional Infopmation  
Real-time Quotes Corporate Actions
Delayed Quotes Markets  
Time & Sales Data Financial Instruments
Calculated Values Stock Market Listings Business, News  
Historical Prices 8rd paity data (depending on local markets)  
The apiD infrastructure is based on a modular concept. In this way, a range of different client solutions — Internet, Intranet or Extranet
applications, or the supply of data for special applications such as asset management systems — can be implemented with a minimum of
fuss. With apiD, clients can use a host of predefined functions to create an application, or integrate data into their applications, easily and
quickly. The most important of these are:  
e — Search functions for pinpointing securities, compariiés or trading places, based on a variety of criteria  
e — User-friendly market summaries with predefined lists  
e — Easy-to-read portfolio function for assembling and managing client portfolios  
 — Convenient limit-monitoring feature  
e Functions for generating simple or more complex charts on the basis of predefined forms (with Java-API or JSP)  
e —Heatmap functions for the graphical display of market overviews, complete with the biggest gainers/losers (with Java-API or JSP)
There are three API levels to serve different customer needs:  
XML format for real-time data delivery with automatic (push) and/or manual updates.  
e — Java-API for.developing applications in a Java environment. Java-API is based on XML format and a Java library. The Telekurs
display product Telekurs iD was developed using this Java-API.  
e JSP Tag for developing request-based HTML solutions (Intranet, Extranet or Internet solutions with customized layouts). This
interface can also be used to retrieve the financial and news data in a format other than XML, e.g., in “csv” format.  
For data\integration, Telekurs Financial offers the possibility of cooperation with authorized apiD partners, thus ensuring comprehensive
advice and support.  
Product Delivery  
apiD has the same basic structure and architecture as the Telekurs iD generation of display products. The apiD server provides access to
data and functions via technical interfaces. Data can be supplied either through the standard XML or Java-API interfaces and/or via JSP.  
Customer Access  
Depending on individual customer needs and data volumes, an application can access the apiD server directly in the server zone of
Telekurs Financial.
