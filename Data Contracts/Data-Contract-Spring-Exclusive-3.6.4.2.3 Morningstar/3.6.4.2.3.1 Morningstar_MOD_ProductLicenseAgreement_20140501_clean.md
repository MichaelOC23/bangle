The below language is a guide to assist Licensee in meeting FINRA and other regulatory disclosure requirements
related to the use of ratings and other data in marketing materials. Licensee may find alternative ways to display the
necessary disclosure elements that may also meet regulators requirements. In the event that the FINRA or other

If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Rating, Licensee may include the  
following disclaimer:  
Open End Mutual Funds, Closed End Funds, or Variable Annuity Underlying Funds  
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based
on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts fer variation in a funds’ ineathly
performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing mare emphasis
on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category
receive § stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 38% receive 3 stars, thmext 22.5% receive 2
stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star, (Each share class is counted as a\fraction of one fund within
this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the Uisttibution percentages.) The
Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if epplicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. {insert name of
fund| was rated against the following number of U.S. domiciled insert name of category] funds over the
following time periods: [insert number of funds in category during prior 3-year period| funds in the last
three years, |insert number of funds in category during tha prior S-year period] funds in the last five
years, and liasert number of funds in category during the prior 10-year period] funds in the last ten
years. With respect to these [insert name of category! [unds, jinsert name of fund] received a
Morningstar Rating of finsert number of stars for G»year rating| stars, [insert number of stars for 5-year
rating] stars and jinsert number of stars for 10-year rating| stars for the three-, five- and ten-year
periods, respectively. Past performance is ne-guarantec of future results.  
In the event a fund has multi-class funds,.the following language should also be included:  
Morningstar Rating is for the Share class only; other classes may have different performance
characteristics.  
Exchange Traded Funds
The Morningstar Rating" is provided for those exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) with at least a three-  
year history. Ratings wre based on the ETF's Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Retura measure which
accounts for variatiod in monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and
rewarding consistent performance. An ETF’s risk-adjusted return includes a brokerage commission
estimate. Thisvestimate is intended to reflect what an average investor would pay when buying or selling
an ETF/PLEASE NOTE, this estimate is subject to change and the actual brokerage commission an
investor pays may be higher or lower than this estimate. Morningstar compares each ETF’s risk-adjusted
returnto the epen-end mutual fund rating breakpoints for that category. Consistent with the open-end
stufteal fund ratings, the top 10% of ETFs in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars,
dhe next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive I star. The
overall rating fer an ETP is based on a weighted average of the time-period ratings (e.g., the ETF’s 3,5,
and 1@ year rating).  
 The determination of an ETE’s rating dees not affect the retail open end mutual
fund data published by Morningstar, Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

if Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Rating for Load-Waived A
Shares, Licensee may include the following disclaimer:  
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating’ based
on how a fund ranks one Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same
category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance after adjusting for
sales loads (except for load-waived A shares) redemption fees, and the risk-free rate, placing more
emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each
entegory receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 2 stars and the bottem 10% receive | star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a find is derived.
from a weighted average ef the ratings for the three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) time periods.
Lead-waived A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales Joad and are intended for those
investors who have access to such purchase terms (¢.g., plan participants of a defined contribufion plan).
Not all A share mutual funds for which Morningstar calculates a load-waived A share star rating may
actually waive their front-end sales toad. Therefore, Morningstar strongly encourages investors to
contact their investment professional to determine whether they are eligible to purchasethe A share

Separate Accounts
Hf Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Momingstar Rating™ for separate accounts,  
Licensee may include the folowing disclaimer:  
The Morningstar Rating for separate accounts, commonly called the star rating, is a measure of a
separate account's risk-adjusted return, relative to other separate accounts in the same Morningstar
Category. Separate accounts are rated frof) iia 5 stars, with the best performers receiving 5 stars and
the worst performers receiving | star. Separate accounts are rated for up to three periods (three, five,
and 10 years), and ratings are recalculated each quarter. The Morningstar Rating for separate accounts
uses an enhanced risk-adjusted return measure, which accounts for all varintions in a separate account’s
monthly performance, with mor@ emphasis on downward variation. Separate accounts are ranked
against others in the same category and stars are assigned as follows: Top 10% 45 stars, Next 22.5% 4
stars, Middle 35% 3 stars\ Next 22.5% 2 stars, Bottom 10% 1 star.  
Notes  
Fees for separate accounts can vary widely and are negotiated between the asset manager, the separate
account program sponsor or advisor, and the investor. Morningstar has chosen to employ the AIMRapproved stand@rd of gross-of-fees performance (before fees have been taken out) to compare separate
accounts, Net-of-fees calculations often deduct the highest theoretical fees that an investor may pay.
The Morsingstar Rating uses an enhanced risk-adjusted return measure based on “expected utility
theory7\which accounts for all variations in a separate account’s monthly performance, with more
emphasis on dowaward variation, Morningstar will not calculate ratings for categories er time periods
thaf contain fewer than five separate accounts. Each investor in the same separate account can
experience slightly different total returns, because investors have different account preferences and
restrictions. Therefore, all separate account performance data is reported to Morningstar as a
“composite” of similarly managed portfolios.  
Separate accounts thet de not have ratings can be divided into two groups: these that do net qualify to be
rated and these that did not participate. A separate account will aot get a Morningstar Rating if: It is less
than three years old, the firm is not AIMR-compliant, the category contains fewer than five separate
accounts that are eligible for a rating.

Morningstar Style Box™
In the event Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Style Box™, Licensee may
include the following disclaimer:  
The Morningstar Style Box™ reveals a fund's investment strategy.
For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the long stocks owned and the
horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth).  
For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the long bonds owned and the
horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration.  
Morningstar secks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (c.g., quarterly). In
compiling credit rating information Morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that
have been issued by all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs))For a list of all
NRSROs, please visit http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/ratingsgency.htm. Additionally,
Morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies. If two
rating organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lower rating; if
three or more organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies areto report the median
rating, and in cases where there are more than two organization/agency ratings and a median rating does
not exist, fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings’ PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar,
Inc. is not itself an NRSRO ner does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO or rating agency
ratings can change from time-to-time.  
For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies
with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The
weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a
leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style bor placement of “low”, "medium", or "high" based on
their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit qdality are those whose weighted-average credit
quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than “AA-", but greater or equal to
“BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-nyerage credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying
a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credié ratings of the underlying holdings to their
respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates).
Morningstar then averages these defailt-rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond
fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this sverage default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a
convex curve.  
For interest-rate sensitivity, Moraingstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration.
Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective
duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBD, which is currently three years. The classification
af Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of
MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of
the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective
duration ofthe MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains
from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These
breakpoints are as follows: (2) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (3) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than
7 veays; and (HD Extensive: more than 7 years, In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled
fixed income funds static duration breakpoints sre used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; GD}
Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (lil) Extensive: greater than 6 years.

Morningstar Analyst Rating  
If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Analyst Rating, Licensee may
include the following disclaimer:  
The Morningstar Analyst Rating is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by
the mutual fund analysts of Morningstar, Inc. Morningstar evaluates funds based on five key pillars,
which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. Morningstar's analysts use this five pillar
evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over  
the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. Analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their
research, and the weighting of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating ultinately reflects the analyst's
overall assessment and is overseen by Morningstar's Analyst Rating Coniniittee. The approach serves not
as 8 formula but as a framewerk ta ensure consistency across Morningstar's  
global coverage universe.  
The Analyst Rating scale ranges from Gold to Negative, with Gold being the highest rating and Negative
being the lowest rating. A fund with a "Gold" rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has
garnered the analysts' highest level of conviction. A-fund with a 'Silver' rating has notable advantages
across several, but perhaps not all, of the five pillars-atrengths that give the analysts a high level of
conviction. A “Brenze"-rated fund has advantages that outweigh  
the disadvantages acrass the five pillars, with Sufficient level ef analyst conviction to warrant a positive
rating. A fund with » ‘Neutral rating isn'tseriously flawed across the five pillars, nor does it distinguish
itself very positively, A "Negative" rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars  
and is considered an inferior offering to its peers. Analyst Ratings are reevaluated at least every 14
months.
