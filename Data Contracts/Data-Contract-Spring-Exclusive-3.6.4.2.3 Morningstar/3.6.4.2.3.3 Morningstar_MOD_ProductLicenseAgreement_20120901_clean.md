If the last sentence of the above disclosure or substantially similar language is included elsewhere, where it is clear
that it pertains to all data including that of Licensor, it is not necessary for Licensee to repeat it.  
Morningstar Rating  
The below language is a guide to assist in meeting FINRA and other regulatory disclosure requirements related to
the use of ratings and other data in marketing materials. Licensee may find alternative ways to display the necessary
disclosure elements that may also meet regulators requirements. In the event that the FINRA or other regulatory
agency requires revisions to the following disclaimer, Licensee may make such changes as deemed appropriate:  
If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Rating, Licensee may include the
following disclaimer:  
For open end funds, closed end funds or variable annuity underlying funds  
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™
based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s
monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing
more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of
funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars,
the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a
fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the
distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating fora fund is derived from a weighted
average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. [Insert name of fund] was rated against the following numbers of U.S.domiciled [insert name of category] funds over the following time periods: [insert number of funds in
category during prior 3-year period] funds in the lastthree years, [insert number of funds in
category during the prior 5-year period] funds irnthe last five years, and [insert number of funds in
category during the prior 10-year period] funds in the last ten years. With respect to these [insert
name of category] funds, [insert name of fund) received a Morningstar Rating of [insert number of
stars for 3-year rating] stars, [insert number of stars for 5-year rating] stars and [insert number of
stars for 10-year rating] stars for the-three-, five- and ten-year periods, respectively. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results.  
In the event a fund has multi-class funds, the following language should also be included:  
Morningstar Rating is for the share class only; other classes may have different performance
characteristics.  
For ETFS  
The Morningstar Rating™ is provided for those exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) with at least a
three-yearntiistory. Ratings are based on the ETF’s Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure
which accounts for variation in monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward
variations and rewarding consistent performance. An ETF’s risk-adjusted return includes a
brokerage commission estimate. This estimate is intended to reflect what an average investor would
pay when buying or selling an ETF. PLEASE NOTE, this estimate is subject to change and the actual
brokerage commission an investor pays may be higher or lower than this estimate. Morningstar
compares each ETF’s risk-adjusted return to the open-end mutual fund rating breakpoints for that
category. Consistent with the open-end mutual fund ratings, the top 10% of ETFs in each category
receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2
stars and the bottom 10% receive I star. The overall rating for an ETF is based on a weighted
average of the time-period ratings (e.g., the ETF’s 3,5, and 10 year rating).  
 The determination of an
ETF’s rating does not affect the retail open end mutual fund data published by Morningstar. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results.

Morningstar Rating for Load-Waived A-Shares
If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Rating for Load-Waived A Shares,
Licensee may include the following disclaimer:  
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™
based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in
the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund’s monthly performance after
adjusting for sales loads (except for load-waived A shares) redemption fees, and the risk-free rate,
placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top
10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3
stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar
Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the ratings for the three -, five- and\ten-year
(if applicable) time periods. Load-waived A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales
load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms (e.g:, plan
participants of a defined contribution plan). Not all A share mutual funds for which Morningstar
calculates a load-waived A share star rating may actually waive their front-end sales load. Therefore,
Morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine
whether they are eligible to purchase the A share without paying the frontioad. {Insert name of
fund| was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled {insert ame of category] funds over
the following time periods: [insert number of funds in category during prior 3-year period] funds in
the last three years, {insert number of funds in category during the prior 5-year period] funds in the
last five years, and [insert number of funds in category during the prior 10-year period] funds in the
last ten years, With respect to these [insert name of category}jfunds, [insert name of fund] received a
Morningstar Rating of [insert number of stars for 3-year rating] stars, [insert number of stars for 5year rating] stars and {insert number of stars for 10-year rating] stars for the three-, five- and tenyear periods, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Morningstar
Rating may differ among share classes of a mutual fund as a result of different sales loads and/or
expense structure.  
Morningstar Rating based on Extended Performance  
If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Produc?\containing the Morningstar Rating™ for certain fund share
classes whose ratings are based on returns prior to’the inception of that particular share class, (funds not typically
rated by Licensor and based on adjusted histOrical returns), Licensee shall include the following disclaimer:  
Please note, some of the Morningstar proprietary calculations, including the Morningstar Rating™,
are not customarily caleulatéd based on adjusted historical returns. The evaluation of this investment
does not affect the retail mutual fund data published by Morningstar. For each retail mutual fund
with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a
Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly
performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more
emphasis oj downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in
each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next
22.5Ysreceive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of
one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution
percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted
average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. This investment’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then
compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
[Insert name of fund] was rated against the folowing numbers of U.S.-domiciled [insert name of

for the three-, five- and ten-year periods, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.  
Morningstar Rating for Separate Accounts
If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Rating™ for separate accounts,
Licensee may include the following disclaimer:  
The Morningstar Rating for separate accounts, commonly called the star rating, is a measure of a
separate account's risk-adjusted return, relative to other separate accounts in the same Morningstar
Category. Separate accounts are rated from | to 5 stars, with the best performers receiving 5 stars
and the worst performers receiving 1 star. Separate accounts are rated for up to three periods (three,
five, and 10 years), and ratings are recalculated each quarter. The Morningstar Rating for separate
accounts uses an enhanced risk-adjusted return measure, which accounts for all variations in a
separate account’s monthly performance, with more emphasis on downward variation, Separate
accounts are ranked against others in the same category and stars are assigned as fellows: Top  
10% Sstars, Next 22.5% 4 stars, Middle 35% 3 stars, Next 22.5% 2 stars, Bottom 10% 1 star.  
Notes  
Fees for separate accounts can vary widely and are negotiated between the-asset manager, the
separate account program sponsor or advisor, and the investor. Morningstar has chosen to employ
the AIMR-approved standard of gross-of-fees performance (before fees have been taken out) to
compare separate accounts. Net-of-fees calculations often deduct the highest theoretical fees that an
investor may pay.  
The Morningstar Rating uses an enhanced risk-adjusted return measure based on "expected utility
theory," which accounts for all variations in a separate account’s monthly performance, with more
emphasis on downward variation. Morningstar will mot calculate ratings for categories or time
periods that contain fewer than five separate accounts, Each investor in the same separate account
can experience slightly different total returns, because investors have different account preferences
and restrictions. Therefore, all separate account performance data is reported to Morningstar as a
"composite" of similarly managed portfolios:  
Separate accounts that do not have ratings can be divided into two groups: those that do not qualify
to be rated and those that did not participate. A separate account will not get a Morningstar Rating
if: It is less than three years old, the firm is not AIMR-compliant, the category contains fewer than
five separate accounts that are eligible for a rating.  
Morningstar Rating for Group-Variable Annuities
If Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Rating™ for group variable
annuities, Licensee may inghude the following disclaimer:  
The Morningstar Rating™ is provided for those group variable annuities with at least a three-year
history. Ratings are based on the group variable annuity’s Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return
measure Which accounts for variation in monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward
variations and rewarding consistent performance. Morningstar compares each group variable
abnuity’s risk-adjusted return te the open-end mutual fund rating breakpoints for that category. The
group variable annuity Morningstar Rating does not affect the retail mutual fund data published by
Morningstar. Consistent with the open-end mutual fund ratings, the top 10% of group variable
annuities in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3
stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar
Rating for each group variable annuity is derived from a weighted average of the performance
figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
{Insert name of group variable annuity| was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled
[insert name of category] funds over the following time periods: [insert number of funds in category
during prior 3-year period] funds in the last three years, [insert number of funds in category during

Additional language  
Morningstar Style Box™  
In the event Licensee uses or displays that part of the Product containing the Morningstar Style Box™, Licensee may
include the following descriptive language:  
The Morningstar Style Box™ reveals a fund’s investment strategy. For equity funds the vertical axis
shows the market capitalization of the long stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment
style (value, blend or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of
the long bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond’s
effective duration.  
Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g.,
quarterly). In compiling credit rating information Morningstar accepts crédit ratings reported by
fund companies that have been issued by all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations
(NRSROs). For a list of all NRSROs, please visit
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/ratingagency.htm. Additionally, Morningstar accepts foreign
credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies. If two rating
organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lower rating; if three
or more organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund)companies are to report the median
rating, and in cases where there are more than two organization/agency ratings and a median rating
does not exist, fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings. PLEASE NOTE:
Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor doés it.issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO or
rating agency ratings can change from time-to-time.  
For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund
companies with an average default rate caiculation to come up with a weighted-average credit
quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the
scale used by a leading NRSRO, Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium",
or "high" based on their average \credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose
weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than
"AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of
"AA-" or higher. Whenclassifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit
ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's
analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to
determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average
default rate(to‘its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve.  
For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective
duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on
the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBJ), which is currently three years.
‘Fhe classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is
between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration
is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or
greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive.  
For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective
duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited:
4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more
than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static
duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal te 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater
than 3,5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
