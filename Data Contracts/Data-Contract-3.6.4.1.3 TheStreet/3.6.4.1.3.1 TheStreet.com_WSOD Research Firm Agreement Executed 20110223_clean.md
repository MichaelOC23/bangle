overall consensus rating. The reports include but are not limitedto: a company consensus report, list-based reports (eg. upgrades, downgrades, coverage list, select
list) and an overall team performance report (showing performance of the team across all covered companies).  
Per Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 ofthis Agreement, Research Firm shall agree to participate in the Consensus Product.  
At WSOD’s discretion, WSOD can include Research Firm’s ratings in the Consensus Product. WSOD can also measure the performance of Research Fitm’s
ratings, and such performance results may be included in Consensus Product. If Research Firm is atop performer, WSOD can, at WSOD’s discretion, include the
Research Firm’s name in the Consensus Product.  
The following section describes the calculation used to determinethe revenue sharing arrangement for those research firms included in the Conséasus Product:  
1. Net Quarterly Subscription Revenue is defined as revenue collected for the Consensus Product, minus applicable taxes'atid service fees (ie. credit
card fees), such service fees not to exceed 5% of such revenue.
Research Pool Share is defined as 90% of the Net Quarterly Subscription Revenue.
‘WSOD’s Share is defined as 10% of the Net Quarterly Subscription Revenue.
The Research Pool Share shall be distributed among those research firms included in the Consensus Produtt,using the following calculation:
The portion of the Research Pool Share given to each research firm will consist of two sections: a)Flat Participation Allocation payment and a
Performance Based Allocation Share payment.
a. The Flat Participation Allocation is defined as 30% of the Research Pool Share. The Flat Participation Allocation shall be divided into
equal payments across all research firms included in the Consensus Product.
b. The Performance-Based Allocation is defined as 70% of the Research Pool Share The Performance-Based Allocation payment shall be
determined based on the calculation described below.
i. The Performance-Based Allocation payment will be determined based on the performance generated by the research firms
for the securities mcluded in the Consensus Product.
ii, On a quarterly basis, WSOD will measure the performance of the research firms’ ratings on individual securities using a net
total retums-based performance methodology.  
iii, Theresearch firm with the top performance in 4 giyen security will be allocated a Symbol Score (defined below), based on
the coverage universe of the winning research fitm in the Consensus Product and the number of other research firms that
provide a rating forthe given security.  
iv.  ?]The Symbol Score is defined as the'imber of research firms covering the symbol, multiplied by the inverse of the number
of symbols covered by the winning research firm within the Consensus Product.  
1. For example,
a.  Ifresearch, firm A has the top performance (is the winner) for MSFT,
b. _ and research firm A covers 500 symbols in the Consensus Product,
c.  andthere are 10 other firms covering MSFT inthe Consensus Product,
d. (the symbol score for research firm A on MSFT would be 0.02 points.
2. Inanotherexample,
a. if research firm B had the top performance (is the winner) for [BM,
b. and there were 20 other providers covering IBM,
c. and research firm B had a coverage universe of 20,
d. the Symbol Score for IBM for research firm B would be | point.  
v. . THe Dotal Score for a given research firm is defined asthe sum of all Symbol Scores for the given research firm, divided by
theltotal sum of all Symbol Scores allocated to all research firms.  
1. For example, if research firm A had 100 points acrossall of ther Symbol Scores,  
Wee  
2.  andthere were a total of 1,000 points across all Symbol Scores,
3. the Total Score for research firm A would be 10%.  
vi. The Performance-Based Allocation Share is defined as the Total Score multiplied by the Performance-Based Allocation
(defined above). For example, If the Total Score is 10%, the Performance Based Allocation Share for the given research firm
is 7% (= 10%*70%)  
c. For purposes of illustration only,
i. ifthe Research Pool Share is $100,
ii. andthe Total Score for research firm A is 10%,
iii, andthe total number of research firms in the Consensus Product is 15,
iv. the total quarterly payment toresearch firm A would be $9.
