based in the United States, its territories and possessions as reported by FINRA, subject to a
minimum monthly fee of $4,200 per subscriber; commencing January 1, 2009, the monthly fee
becomes $22.00 times the number of a Subscriber’s registered representatives based in the United

their locations worldwide. In addition, payment of the Enterprise Rate Professional Subscriber
Fee by a Subscriber allows OPRA’s Basic Service to be made available to independent
investment advisers who are undercontract with the Subscriber to provide investment advisory
services to the Subscriber’s customers. All such investment advisers will be deemed to be
registered representatives of the Subscriber for purposes of calculating the Subscriber’s
Enterprise Rate Professional Subscriber Fee.
