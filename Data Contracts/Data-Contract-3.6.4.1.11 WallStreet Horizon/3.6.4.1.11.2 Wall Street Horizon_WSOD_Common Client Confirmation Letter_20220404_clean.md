Mr. Barry Star,  
Chief Executive Officer  
Wall Street Horizon, Inc.  
400 West Cummings Park #3650
Woburn, MA 01801  
Dear Mr. Star:  
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL  
In March of 2021 Wall Street Horizon requested that, by July 1, 2021, clients receiving Wall Street
Horizon data from Markit Digital (aka Markit on Demand, Inc.) via a hosted solution, either (1) have a
direct license in place with Wall Street Horizon; or (2) Markit Digital have a license in place with Wall
Street Horizon on behalf of the client. If neither of these licenses were put into place, the client’s access
to the Wall Street Horizon data was to be removed.  
Table 1 shows a summary of the client names and Wall Street Horizon data types delivered by Markit
Digital as of March 2021:
