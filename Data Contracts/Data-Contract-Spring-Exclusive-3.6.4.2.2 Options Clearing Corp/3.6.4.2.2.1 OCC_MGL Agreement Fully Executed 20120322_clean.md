1.  
Data Distribution Service  
OCC’s DDS permits Subscriber: (a) to select various message types(“tessage” or “messages”) in order to
access or receive data; (b) to select whether Subscriber will accesS.messages itself, or receive messages
from OCC; and (c) to select whether access or receipt will be “real time,” in “batches,” or both, all as a part
of OCC’s DDS. (For convenience, the term “delivery” is hereinafter used to describe the process of either
“accessing” or “receiving” messages.) Subscriber elects to°receive DDS on a distribution or o nondistribution basis (check applicable box).  
Subscriber shall cause its designated representatiVe(s) to contact OCC’s Member Services Department to
make its selections in order to receive DDS_or (o modify previously made selections. OCC reserves the
right in its sole discretion to add, delete, or modify messages, applicable delivery methods, and frequency
of delivery upon such notice to the Subscriber that OCC deems to be reasonable and practicable under the
circumstances, and Subscriber agrees-to-reasonably cooperate with OCC with respect to implementing such
changes. Modifications made to Subscriber’s message and delivery selections shall be effective as of the
date specified by OCC. An overview of DDS is contained in the attached Annex I.  
Certain Representations, Acknowledgments, and Agreements  
2.1 If Subscriber ‘has elected a non-distribution subscription, Subscriber is permitted to use and copy
the messages for its internal business purposes only (provided such purpose is lawful), but
Subscriber’shall not redistribute or provide the messages or any copy thereof to any third party
unless\required to do so by operation of law. Subscriber agrees to reproduce on any internal
copies of such messages any copyright notice of OCC included with the messages.  
2.2 If Subscriber has elected a distribution subscription, Subscriber is permitted to use and copy the
messages for any lawful purpose and provide copies of the messages to any third party provided
that it reproduces on such copies any copyright notice of OCC included with the messages.  
23 Subscriber agrees to pay OCC the fees applicable to its selected subscriptions as set forth in
OCC’s Schedule of Fees as may be amended from time to time. OCC’s Schedule of Fees is
published on its web site at www.optionsclearina.com. OCC will provide Subscriber with 30
calendar days’ prior notice (which may be provided by email) of any change in the fees applicable
to its selected subscriptions. OCC will invoice Subscriber for such fees on a monthly basis, and
Subscriber agrees to pay the amounts reflected in such invoice within 30 calendar days from the
date of such invoice. Subscriber shall pay and be responsible for any taxes (including, without
limitation, sales, lease or use taxes) which may be imposed on Subscriber or OCC (other than

sole discretion to (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6 hereof or (ii) require an
interest payment of the overdue amount at a rate of 1.5% per month.  
25 Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that each method for delivering messages as a part of DDS is
a secure and commercially reasonable means for delivering such messages. Subscriber is
responsible for providing and maintaining its own computer and communications equipment and
services needed to use DDS, and OCC shall have no responsibility with respect thereto.

agrees that such messages are final when delivered on each day that OCC effects message delivery
as apart of DDS. If Subscriber selects delivery of messages on a “real time basis”, Subscriber

and shall be subject to revision until OCC has transmitted an “end of day” meSsage indicating that
OCC will not deliver any further DDS messages to Subscriber for a particular activity date. Even

to Subscriber on a batch basis in the event: (a) OCC experiences problems with communication
channels, computer equipment, or applications; (b) OCC experientes\problems that affect DDS; or
(c) under such other circumstances as OCC deems appropriate.’ OCC will endeavor to notify
Subscriber about the change in delivery methods as,\feasonably practicable under the
circumstances, and will reinstitute real time delivery when OCC deems it appropriate to do so.

notify OCC and shall effect such adjustments as requested by OCC to correct the bona fide error
or omission.

ANNEX I: Data Distribution Services Messages — Non-clearing Organization  
Non-clearing Organizations are eligible to subscribe to the following non-proprietary DDS message types.

recipients.  
All messages may be received in batch, using the FTP+ thin client provided by Sterling Commerce.
Messages to be received in batch may be “packaged” together in various combinations, or packaged
individually. When organizing a package, keep in mind that it cannot be published/sent until the. final
message type included in the package is completed. This chart identifies all messages that are available
to non-clearing organizations. Approximate timeframes (Central) are included to assist in determining  
package contents.
