2. Subscriber’s use of Index Data provided by ICE Data’s affiliate, ICE Data Pricing &

the following terms and conditions, in addition to and with precedence over any other applicable
provisions of this Agreement:  
(a) In the event that Subscriber at any time receives data from ICE PRD containing
evaluations, rather than market quotations, for certain securities or certain other data related to
such securities, the following provisions will apply: (i) Evaluated securities are typically
complicated financial instruments. There are many methodologies (including computer-based
analytical modeling and individual security evaluations) available to generate approximations of
the market value of such securities, and there is significant professional disagreement about which
is best. No evaluation method, including those used by ICE PRD Pricing and Reference Data; may
consistently generate approximations that correspond to actual "traded" prices of the instruments;
(ii) ICE PRD's methodologies used to provide the pricing portion of certain Datasmay rely on
evaluations; however, Subscriber acknowledges that there may be errors or defects in ICE PRD's
software, databases, or methodologies that may cause resultant evaluations to be-inappropriate for
use in certain applications; and (iii) Subscriber assumes all responsibility for edit checking,
external verification of evaluations, and ultimately the appropriateness“of use by Subscriber of
evaluations and other pricing data provided via the Index Data Services; regardless of any efforts
made by ICE PRD in this respect.  
(b) Subscriber acknowledges that the data provided-by ICE PRD is intended for use as
an aid to institutional investors, registered brokers or professionals of similar sophistication in
making informed judgments concerning securities.  
(c) Subscriber accepts responsibility) for, and acknowledges it exercises its own
independent judgment in, its selection of any ICE PRD available via the Index Data Services, its
selection of the use or intended use of such data. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be
a waiver of any rights existing under applicable law for the protection of investors.  
(d) ICE PRD is a registered investment adviser. Pursuant to the provisions of the
