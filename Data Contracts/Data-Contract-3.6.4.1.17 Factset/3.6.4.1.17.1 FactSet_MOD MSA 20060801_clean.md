14.2 Availability - “Availability” means the amount of time in’a calendar month during which Client may access and has use of the
Customized Solution. “Available Hours” means all timés)of day and night, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, excluding Scheduled
Outages.
14.3 Uptime - “Uptime” shall be calculated as a percentage by taking the total number of minutes within the Available Hours for the
month, minus the total number of minutes of Monitored Product Failure divided by the total number of minutes within the Available
Hours for the month. For example, in a thirty day month, there are 43,200 minutes, assuming all the minutes in the month are counted
as Available Hours. During this month, 432‘minutes of Monitored Product Failures would constitute a 1% loss of Uptime (432/43,200
= 1%). Uptime in a month with 432 minutes of Monitored Product Failure would be 99%.
14.4 Exclusions - WSOD is responsible for resolving all System, and Application related problems. Degraded Performance due to
Client's infrastructure, or telecommunications failure beyond WSOD’s contro! will not affect service level performance standards for
purposes of the Service Level ¢alculations.

consecutive hours‘in léngth during which the System shall be inaccessible. Scheduled Outages will occur on Saturday of the
first full weekend bf the month between 10:00pm and 4:00am Eastern time. WSOD may require additional time; any additional
time taken is not considered a Scheduled Outage. Scheduled Outages are excluded from System Availability calculations.
b) Thetésting periods will exclude any non-scheduled and scheduled outages of the Third Party Monitoring Provider.
c) The testing periods will exclude any failure due to any third party telecommunications provider.
dy ‘Connections that fail due to unavailability of a third party provider of the Client will not be included in the service level
performance calculations.
€) The failure of any third party hardware or software to perform in accordance with its manufacturer’s specifications that
is not caused by WSOD negligence or willful misconduct will be excluded from the testing periods.
14:5 Monitoring - WSOD and Client will agree on System pages to monitor. Each page shall be monitored from more than one
Jocation outside of WSOD’s network on a round-robin basis at least once every five minutes. A page will fail a monitoring test (a
Monitored Product Failure) if ali monitoring locations fail to access a page in two successive tries from each monitoring location.
14.6 Remedies - Following the launch of the Customized Solution, the following remedies shall be available to Client for a failure of
the WSOD Services to meet the specified service levels:
