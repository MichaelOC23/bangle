EXHIBIT A  
PROVIDER’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan  
Benzinga Backup and Disaster Recovery  
This document outlines Benzinga’s critical resources and outlines storage and recovery plans.  
90% Infrastructure could be spun up within 24hrs considering, and much less-focusing on any
single service. The main bottleneck for any data service are the recovery time from network /
disk I/O for our Content and Datastores.  
1 Recovery Point Objective / RPO  
24 Hours - Designated RPO, however, aim for a much-higher standard for news, and data. All
critical data is backed-up with in a 24hr period or more frequently.  
2 Recovery Time Objective / RTO  
Being a service provider to the active trader community, 0 downtime is our expectation during
market hours, and much isn’t tolerated during off-hours.  
3 Recovery Responsibility
As a whole}.the platform (backend and operation) engineering team is responsible for recovery
of all services. Some services have individual owners who specialize in development an
ownership of that service, however, most setup is run to be replicable and documented so any
individual on the team may help.
