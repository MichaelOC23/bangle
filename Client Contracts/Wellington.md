Exactly. This is perfect for us. Yeah. Yeah.
Cool. So Yela you'll be prepared to demo.
Nighty-o-o-o-o-yay.
Or she's thinking about it.
Great, great.
To be honest with you Vincent, I think you're in a listening role to obviously recover what systems you're going to integrate
You know, they've got a lot of existing structure.
that I probably want to use.
You know that that that that that rock and roll for it, but you know mainly it's
team up for all that stuff will be decided in the functional design.
Yeah, so supporting listening role is going to be happy that we're all
there and committed. It's obviously got a budget so let's close it. Yeah and just to remind you guys
I actually was working with Steven and his team right before things changed out in Vesca. And they were, by the end, yeah, no, I don't know why I couldn't get that deal done. But by the end, they were basically selling me. They're like, no, you can do this. I was like, I know.
A few weeks ago I could have done it, I can't do it now.
But like so he's been trying to find ways to work with us so I think if we just make it super easy and are like Stephen will send you over a work order let's get going.
We'll even do it with you in London if you want.
Great, okay, I think then
We just have to sell something. That's really all we have to do.
Hahahaha
easy cool I think then we are
Anything else for this period John? Nothing will.
I think we're good. Awesome. Thank you guys.
We are...
Now that all of that looks
empty canvas
You know, obviously just to bring you up to day.
And what we saw was the opportunity to unify the communication client and
Market Day 2 to 1 platform.
Also, using the maturity of the base technology will leverage
the things that an Irish market is so market-on-the-market
on FinCenCric to then take advantage of our low code
front end and you know
in the books is basically shown capabilities.
is very much an internal book.
you've got a lot of assets in there.
to share with you.
You know, one of the things that I always like in
in business and we've done this many times. We did it for Citi when they were trying to be a challenger bank in A.
Um, they were just, they were just,
They were potentially getting the license, they hadn't got the license and really a lot of the seniors including Jane Fraser were having trouble visualising what it was and basically so they mandated a case study with us
We built what we call a working, unwide solution which means that the downstream systems were just not connected. But what it enabled us to do is basically show a complete mobile
experience and on the back of the mobile experience that was in the best now we basically you know joining our except our excess is fate and was it again an agent
Fabio got behind it and said well let's borrow it and let's make it into a real
These things are pretty easy to do for us and not that expensive in the real time but what you get is because of my
So it is wide to a lot of, you know, a lot of across the country.
and then you just start the thing.
that would be you.
things that they see. I mean obviously you know you guys
But if you wanted to, you know, be in front of a car and turn it off,
up and say that if you're in wealth this is how you would be
to you on the pace that you want to work at.
But the only thing I do know is that there's nothing quite
And when we showed it to Jamie, Jamie actually stood up and started clapping and dancing.
which then prompted the other sexiest status.
I'm going to check if it'll be like you're going to play it.
The body was...
I'm gonna make that good, I know.
You can see my screen, you can see my microphone.
Perfect.
So as John said, really, community-friendly centric is all about being
communication
So what I want to show you is a few things.
I'm going to be a little client-centric from what I showed you because that's what we're talking about here from what I understand soon. And so I want to show you what it is to have a
I'm a client experience, so I networked individual, write a wealth, and I also
I think the really fun show would be on a mobile experience. So I'm going to show you a mobile experience. We are big believers.
you know obviously in the world of you know design first and mobile first and that really is where people on the
I'm going to show you a little bit of that.
that quickly off-line basics and then I want to look at a little bit of what we
also believe here at Communify Concentric is the idea of community and how that actually really benefits an advisor relationship as a high worth individual.
and then the general starts to share important information or watch lists or whatever with their community, whether it's their spouse, whether it's their family, whether it's a business partner, and then with that
brings us suddenly an opportunity for advisors to get to know their extended network.
even have opportunities for referrals, right? And things like that. So we think that community aspect is important. So I'll just touch on that quickly.
But I think what's important about it is that
It means it's just very innovative.
and evolving platform, right?
bring new components to life, change components, offer
configuration for whether it's like different divisions or different client segments things like that.
So that's really it for the couple things that I wanted to talk about.
that I want to go through.
Perfect. So as I said, starting here on the catalog, and just quickly about this, this is a view that I have, let's say, as an internal user, where I can go through internal, sorry, maybe to an advisory shop, or I'm doing a little bit of shopping, or I'm looking through, or I'm looking through,
I can see that these are the components that I've got permission to see. So here's a subset that I have here. I can see a little bit of information about each of them. I can see tags. I can even see some further information.
But I also get is a serial number. And we're making the serial numbers because if you think back to the last time you were on an airplane, so for us to be on a spot like a few days ago, a week ago.
And you're on an airbus, you're in the bathroom, and you look up and you see
see like every little like
And every little light has a serial number because that's how they inventory and control and know
airplane, what parts are flying in the sky that they give in time for that configuration for that particular airline or client.
This serial number in catalogated data means that we can scale and we can offer you the configuration and help you deliver the configuration that you need and scale without worrying about
getting munched up or whatnot. It's a very precise control mechanism and we're big believe
So we have to think how kind of good it is.
look at various pieces if you want and say, oh here's some performance components we could look at or others and yada yada.
So what we've done is configured this for a character, someone called Lena. And I can show you on my phone. I'm just going to pull it up on my phone.
here
I'm also going to show you a computer ready that's going to be easier for you to see. So what I'm going to do is just put this down for a minute and here we have Lena. So Lena's hired with individuals. She's a private chef, restaurant chair here in LA. She's baked in cars. She's a car collection. She gets in in the morning to her community five foot centric or whatever the brand is.
and the first thing she sees is her total net worth. So it's not just her investment accounts. It might be her part of her election, her real estate, etc. It will bring everything from private equity.
that's something that companies struggle to actually consolidate and bring full view together for their wealth clients. So bring that out here, you can obviously see a breakdown of that banking investments, including alerts, maybe that she has set or her advisor has set up her accounts for her private equity
any changes, can even be certain market commentary or content that is published to her. Messages from the platform.
Whether it's messages from our advisory team, the service team, or our friends.
the family. She can also talk news. She's big into news. I'll come back to this in a second. She likes to review things and see where they are. I did this private asset summary where she can look through everything, jewelry, others, etc. Look for individual private assets.
She can go through and view all of those.
for her private assets. Accountless, so she gets an accountless tier, she can drill into kind of a large cap. This is one of her investment accounts you can see there. The account balance, she can go with the top five positions, sector, an industry breakdown, all the basics you would expect to see there. She could also look through all the positions, she could drill through on any of those that she needed to see tax lot, information, position, et cetera. She can go through, she can see your top five positions across all the accounts as well, all those positions we talked about. What she can also do here is you can see there's a little button that's called analysis. She can click analysis and she can see what's called sentiment score. This is where we integrated and basically plugged in an AI engine called AI Suite.
And AI Suite, what it does is it goes to the market, looks at recent commentary views, etc., and gives a sentiment tag. So what it's doing is it's very quickly telling her, oh, the sentiment of the market today is about half, the score is zero through one. So here's a quick AI-generated blur about what's going on in the market.
why the sentiment is about kind of neutral. And then here's some of the articles and I can drill through and read some of those articles if I want.
So very quickly you can kind of just see how things are looking if it's relevant for this client segment We brought in here if it's relevant for advisors, you know for some things it can be on a watch list as well various things like that But what it gives is the opportunity to start bringing in an AI strategy and start giving more personalized views and I'll give you a couple other
examples.
We also have here JBI Insights. So if I could find JBI Insights, what I have now is a
personalize insight. So what this is is this is, and we're just going to bring this up quickly to show you. So what I have is in this case, JBI, our fictitious wealth manager, has created a check report, right? An economic
about leadership, it's always produced not often read.
Yeah, let's hope it's never actually read.
I'm not someone who should be forecasting you're not going to get one.
But if I was, it would be brilliant.
So if you can take it, you can take your own left hand.
What you have is you can take your own knowledge and you can take your private information and your client's private information.
really a private
You're not going out to the greater web, you're not storing information out somewhere where you shouldn't. And you're keeping it private. And you can see that what's happened is that removing her, removing her
portfolio says the technology sector is about 28% of our portfolio. This is what our outlook is on technology. And you can see actually even here if I say technology, you can see that's about 28% of our overarching portfolio.
It can say of course as always reach out to your advisor, mark a few questions, you want to read more about things. So it's just again delivering personalized and customized views that are meaningful to her and quick snippet and she can drill through or then instigate a conversation with her advisor if she wants. So just a few dabbles there of using kind of AI suite, an engine that will be plugged in.
I just made an example, it can be plugged into any engine or engine.
various use cases you might have on any side, whether it's a advisor or client.
Allocation sector industry, right? The basics top holding, activities, movers, research,
I can have a watch list like this. I can have multiple watch lists, different ideas I might have.
I can drill into those and see what this looks like, etc. and look at the fundamentals of that process.
I can look at top stocks, so maybe things that are trending as well. In this case, kind of look at that analysis or I can look here into here and actually view a much deeper and more robust market information about this.
and competitors.
Market in terms of bid ask.
So it's really very interacting that I can look at kind of all the symbols.
whether it's funds, whether it's individual stocks, whether it's information on options and options tables, et cetera. So all that can be brought up here, and you can see all the news, all that beautiful stuff, income projections, performance. So really everything you would expect to see in a client portal. All that robust information, the financial and then the news, more department data, et cetera.
And so the next thing I wanted to show you is a little bit after just, you know, everything you would expect to see from the client world is a little bit of that idea
that community and that sharing that we talked about. I said what we have here that I told you please
She was making the news, she comes down here, she was reading about this in particular. Maybe Morgan.
into into a big into Goldman's pockets taking the apple cart away read that and when she says actually I want to share this because my buddy
So I'm going to pass the drug-free restaurants. Jonah, and I were talking about this. And this is her community. This is her people that she has practically decided she wants to share with her. There's her service team, advisors, or actually friends and family, et cetera. And she says, hey, Jay. Oops.
AJ, three thousandths.
Jamie
Jamie
up to something great.
She's going to share that I'm back here and then let's talk about
that experience, what that is and then the sharing. So what we're going to bring in is we're going to bring in our friend
Hello, Jonah. Good morning.
So Jumas are here. No, it was like a magic show.
Oh.
And so Jonah's over here.
you get some alert.
I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a quick tour of the room.
obviously another client and what is here is that he has this total number that he gets to look around. He has his action list and what's different about this I wanted to point out was that the configurations were slightly different.
He's making the Like To Do list and Action list and he's doing some onboarding stuff with his advisors so they can assign him action, so you can come there and assign other people actions if you want to. He can say, Lena, let's look at that restaurant, lease together for expanding, put timetables on that. He can see things he's delegated, completed. He can go ahead and edit or
He's a big art fan. He has a watch list which is a slightly different configuration than Alina's. Again, he can kind of drill into things, look at it, but he might say I want to add a couple of things.
names
I think today I'm thinking about shoes. We all wear
And
What can I say?
But maybe he wants to go to Lina and he wants to share this. So he can come down and he can say, this is his community. I'm going to choose Lina and I'm going to say, hey, Lina.
In, go, bye, shoot.
I was like, hey, I have this musician and it's almost dull.
Oh
Tell me what is that?
I have two kids now. I need like a lot of money for five two nights.
And he's like, yeah, it's a video. It's doing really well. And I was like, well, you should do it.
We should have shared it with me because when we started the best dog he's like, I bought some apple and I bought some apple and...
John was right, it did very well.
and LinkedIn and all that.
And all I can say to them is, you know, you're a good job. Thanks Will for sharing that tip.
Guys, you can see that we still don't have an A child department.
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.
the idea of sharing things whether it's a dynamic watch list whether it's transaction whether it's documents
I was going in for a visiting session and I thought, oh man, I didn't actually give my husband the information to our banking, our insurance, any of it. That was a bad idea.
I'm leaving home with two kids and I deal with what to do. Right, where I...
I need to really get along and sort of communicate and I can start sharing information. So it's not just about sharing, you know, the image of documents in a portal. It really is this greater landscape of our financial lives are just part of all of our life.
How do you share the relevant pieces, the relevant person?
interacting with those
Absolutely.
You know, I mean, I did it again, but...
the ability not only to share documents,
of a challenge but sharing apps with documents and
nice rhythm
is a different type of challenge.
community. This can literally share anything and have the history and access to what you can do.
things.
just thinking of one case. This is everything you see here is 100% generated. This is just one scenario or thousand scenarios that will be on this platform because in reality service models from people like Wellington are going to be unique to Wellington. The consumption on the other side of your product is going to be unique to them. So you end up with many, many permutations on flows. And this is one of the things why We do a...
a Just shout it guys.
Kevin and I were the same.
I mean, I'm not
There's my barstas, by the way.
Yeah.
So when
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay.
And
Cheers.
as well, right? Yeah.
Yes, I know. That's what I was just thinking, Stephen.
Now we can actually do it.
I was just going to say the data model Steve is as sophisticated as the one that you know from
We've built it from scratch. It's modern tech. Vincent can tell you all about the tech.
Jason Nichols, you might or might not remember.
but Jason Nichols was the main film designer of the model and he's with us today, no surprise.
and
Exactly. Exactly.
Yeah, right and and it's
Yeah, that's for real.
Yeah, and it's everything you know and would think of before with actually
designed intentionally for the combination of the
wealth and institutional space because now it supports out of out of the box the model supports multi sleeve multi strategy you and a
Fund of funds right we've built that in intentionally because you know exactly like you know your situation you have a
distributor, I'm guessing the distributor has you as part of a product or is wrapping your product.
from an SMA perspective and delivering that as a fund, which is a fantastic starting point.
what you can then do with that, right? If they take more and more of your product, you can have your own version of it, you can have...
You can distribute it through an SMA, and we're going to have all the visuals you want.
Wellington is taking an extra step in actually managing the products.
So they have their own view, they have their own capital markets assumption.
Right, and then they are running a product that in the US is wrapped in someone else's phone.
Right, so John will trigger that.
Steve, Steve, why don't we do, why don't we do
you can do two things, obviously you can do a study whenever you need to.
like we know.
Thank you.
These usual stuff we've actually
Yeah
I'm gonna go and talk to you.
You know where we live.
I think it's going to be another one.
Next bill.
Yeah.
Oh, awesome.
Yes. And Steve, if I can just say it to explicit.
The study that we might do, we can do the study with an idea that it's the institutional business with a future potential 10% pivot into wealth. Right?
Yeah
It's lovely to see you guys. Great seeing you.
