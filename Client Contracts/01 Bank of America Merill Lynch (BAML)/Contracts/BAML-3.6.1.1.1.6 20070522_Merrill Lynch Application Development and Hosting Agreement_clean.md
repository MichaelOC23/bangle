4.1 Credits.  
In each case of a failure to satisfy a Service Level, Vendor will, within five (5) days from the identification of the
deviation from the applicable Service Level, provide to Customer a plan of activities which will allow Vendor to satisfy
the applicable Service Level at the earliest date practicable. In addition, Customer shall be entitled to recover a Service
Level Credit for Availability and Response Time Service Levels calculated in the manner described below. If a single
event directly causes the failure to achieve more than one Service Level, then only one Service Level Credit will apply.
In such event, Customer will select the Service Level that will be used for the calculation of the Service Level Credit.
Service Level  
Credits for any month will not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the monthly service fees payable for the month in
which the failure occurs. Vendor will apply all Service Level Credits applied to the next calendar month invoice, and

and outstanding, if any, upon termination of this Agreement will be paid to Customer by check, or.by such other means as

First Failure: In the event of a first (1) failure, the Vendor Projéct"Manager and Customer Project Manager will
review (by telephone or in person) Vendor’s plan of activities described in Section 4.1 above, and there shall be no
Service Level Credit attributable to such failure.  
Second Failure: In the event of a second (24) failure (within thirty (30) days of the first a") failure), Customer shall
be entitled to receive a credit equal to of five percerit(5%) of the monthly service fees payable for the month in
which the failure occurs.  
Third and Any Subsequent Failure. In the event of a third (3"4) failure and any subsequent failures (within sixty (60)
days of 1™ failure), for each such failure Customer shall be entitled to receive a credit equal to of fifteen percent
(15%) of the monthly service fees payable for the month in which the failure(s) occurs.  
4.3. Excused Performance Problem.  
Vendor shall not be liable to pay»Service Credits to the extent that such a failure is directly attributable to (i) a
Force Majeure Event; (ii) breaches of this Agreement by Customer, provided that Vendor has provided
Customer with reasonable notice of such breach immediately after becoming aware of it and determining that
such breach will adverselyimpact Vendor's performance of Services and Vendor has used all commercially
reasonable efforts to_perform notwithstanding such breach; or (iii) acts or omissions of Customer, or (iv) the
first manifestation of/an extraordinary latent error or defect in Equipment used by Vendor in providing the
Services (and any’related repeated instances pending the applicable Vendor's correction of the defect) if such
defect was (1)\unknown to Vendor and (2) not disclosed in any information distributed by the third party
licensor, manufacturer, or distributor and (3) not preventable or discoverable through normal testing or
maintenance procedures, (v) any third party failure, including but not limited to, the failure of any data provider
