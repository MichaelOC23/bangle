MASTER AGREEMENT STRUCTURE
A. Entire Understanding. The Master Agreement constitutes the exclusive and entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to its subject matter, and as of the Effective Date. The following contracts listed below will be governed by the terms of
this Agreement as of the Effective Date: Statement of Work #12 (Wells Fargo Contract 128425): Design, Development, and
Hosting of Various Wells Fargo Projects, effective January 1, 2013, entered into by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Markit On
Demand, Inc., as well as any Amendments thereto. Wells Fargo may have other Agreements with Vendor’s affiliates or parent
company which are not intended to be covered by this Agreement but by an agreement with those such affiliates or parent. Any
unilateral terms or conditions on any materials that Vendor regularly uses (e.g., pre-printed materials, order forms, invoices,
browse-wrap or click-wrap terms and conditions) or any standard terms associated with Wells Fargo’s Purchase Order (e.g.,
general terms and conditions attached to the Purchase Order form, but not the deal-specific terms and conditions for the Products
or Services located on the Purchase Order form itself such as for pricing, quantity ordered, or any associated use rights) or the
manner in which the Purchase Order is accepted will be null and void and of no consequence whatsoever in interpreting the
Parties’ legal rights and responsibilities as they pertain to Products or Services provided hereunder.
B. Affiliates. Affiliates of Wells Fargo may order Products or Services hereunder via execution of a Transaction Document,
and, if necessary, a new Attachment. If an Affiliate executes such a Transaction Document, that Affiliate is entitled to all of the
rights and benefits and is bound by all of the obligations of Wells Fargo under the Master Terms and applicable Attachment.
With respect to a given Transaction Document, Vendor will look solely to the Affiliate that signed the Transaction Document to
enforce the performance of the duties and obligations (including any payment or indemnification obligations) under that
Transaction Document. Vendor acknowledges and agrees that no Wells Fargo Affiliate is a guarantor of any other Affiliate’s
duties or obligations.
C. Master Agreement Documents
1. Transaction Documents. These Master Terms are general terms applicable to all Products and Services provided by
Vendor. Attachments contain additional terms specific to certain kinds of Products and Services, e.g., software, hardware or
professional services, or to certain geographies. An Attachment can be entered into at the same time as its related
Transaction Document and in some cases a Transaction Document may include Attachment terms. The Attachment will
specify the types of Transaction Documents authorized under such Attachment, and may include schedules, statements of
work, and Purchase Orders. Each Attachment can support more than one Transaction Document. Each Transaction
Document will be subject to and governed by its Attachment and the Master Terms and will be consecutively numbered.
Vendor agrees that it will not provide Products or Services to Wells Fargo without the appropriate Transaction Document in
place.
2. Attachments. The Parties agree that the Attachments checked below are incorporated into and made part of the Master
Agreement upon the Effective Date set forth above.

As of the Effective Date, the Parties anticipate that the Vendor may perform Offshore Activities and desire to facilitate such
Offshore Activities by incorporating the required country-specific terms in the following Attachments as part of the Master
Agreement.
3. Order of Precedence. The following order of precedence will apply to the interpretation of the various documents: (a)
Transaction Document (including any incorporated subject matter-specific terms and conditions, except as expressly noted to
the contrary); (b) the related Attachment; and (c) the Master Terms, but (a) and (b) will only take priority over the Master
Terms with respect to the specific Products or Services described in such Transaction Document. Modifications intended to
affect all Attachments and Transaction Documents may only be made by a signed amendment to these Master Terms.
PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES
Generally,
1. Assurances. The Vendor will ensure that (a) all Vendor Personnel who provide Products or Services comply at all times
with the terms of the Master Agreement, and (b) it has signed written agreements with Vendor Personnel in furtherance of
Vendor’s obligations under the Master Agreement. Wells Fargo will have the right to object to Vendor Personnel, for any
reason or no reason, including on the basis that the proposed Vendor Personnel is a subcontractor rather than an employee of
the Vendor. Vendor will discuss such objections with Wells Fargo and the parties will mutually agree on the Vendor Personnel
to perform the Services. Each Vendor Personnel will work for the period of time requested by Wells Fargo.
2. Vendor Personnel.
a. Individuals. Except as otherwise provided in the Master Agreement or consented to in a Transaction Document,
Vendor may not use any individual in the provision of Products or Services who is not an employee of the Vendor
(other than staff augmentation contractors subject to the same requirements as the Vendor’s own employees).
Subsections (i)-(iii) below relate to Services performed in the United States; but for individuals performing
Services outside the United States, additional/different restrictions will be set forth in the applicable country-specific
Attachments.
(i) The Vendor represents and warrants that all Vendor Personnel providing Products or Services under this Master
Agreement are legally authorized to work in the country in which the Products or Services are being provided.
(ii) Vendor may not use any individual who is in the United States pursuant to the B-1 category of visa (or any
similar provision under any Law) in the provision of Products or Services, except that an individual possessing
a B-1 visa may provide tangential support to the provision of Products and Services for the limited purposes of
attending business meetings, negotiating contractual terms, attending training sessions, or assisting with
the installation of Products or Services for a period not to exceed ten (10) business days in a calendar year,
provided that no less than fifteen (15) business days prior to such individual arriving at a Wells Fargo facility,
the Vendor submits written notice to Wells Fargo of the name of the individual possessing the B-1 visa and a
description of the individual’s anticipated activities related to the provision of Products and Services.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wells Fargo, in its sole discretion, may, without notice to Vendor, rescind its
prior consent to the use of any individual utilizing a B-1 visa.
(iii) If the provision of Products or Services does not take place at Wells Fargo facilities, Vendor may use an
individual who is in the United States pursuant to the L-1 or H-1B categories of visas (or any similar provision
under any Law). If the provision of Products or Services takes place at Wells Fargo facilities, Vendor may use such
an individual if Vendor provides a list to Wells Fargo of all affected Vendor Personnel (along with the names of
and visa type related to each individual), and Vendor will timely update this information to account for Vendor Personnel
staffing changes, and Wells Fargo does not object to the use of that individual after a reasonable period of time to

```col-md
review such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wells Fargo, in its sole discretion, may at any time object to
the use of any individual utilizing an L-1 or H-1B visa, and will provide the Vendor with notice of its objection. When
Vendor Personnel are at Wells Fargo facilities for periodic, short-term business meetings not to exceed more than
two (2) consecutive work days over a ten (10) work day period (i.e., to scope projects, make presentations, and meet
with Wells Fargo personnel), these activities will not be considered the provision of Products or Services. Vendor
personnel who are in the United States pursuant to the L-1 or H-1B categories of visas (or any similar provision
under any Law) may participate in such short-term business meetings if they will be returning to Vendor facilities to
complete work towards the provision of Products or Services.
b. Dependent Providers. In the Transaction Document, Vendor will disclose to Wells Fargo the names, principal
places of business, and the locations where Vendor’s Dependent Providers (as defined below) perform Services,
which must be approved by Wells Fargo. Vendor will provide Wells Fargo with no less than ninety (90) days’
written notice of any intent to change such Dependent Providers and will obtain Wells Fargo’s prior written
approval before implementing any such change. “Dependent Providers” are Vendor’s subcontractors, suppliers, or
agents (i) upon which Vendor relies for significant commodities or services, the failure of which would render it
impossible or infeasible for Vendor to provide the Products or Services, or (ii) to whom any Customer/Consumer
Information or any Restricted Information will be transferred.
c. Replacement. Upon request and by mutual agreement by Wells Fargo and Vendor, Vendor will remove any and all
non-satisfactory Vendor Personnel and replace such Vendor Personnel with another or others who are reasonably
satisfactory to Wells Fargo. This replacement will occur as quickly as possible. If replaced Vendor Personnel have
been granted access to the Wells Fargo computing systems or networks, Vendor will immediately terminate that
access. Vendor will not charge Wells Fargo a fee to make such replacement, and the replacement will be provided
to Wells Fargo at the same rate as that of the Vendor Personnel being replaced. The period of time required by the
replacement Vendor Personnel to become familiar with the Products or Services being provided under the applicable
Transaction Document will not be charged to Wells Fargo. If Wells Fargo requests that Vendor Personnel be
replaced on a project due to unsatisfactory performance or lack of requisite skills, and Wells Fargo makes such
request within ten (10) business days after such unsatisfactory Vendor Personnel commenced providing Services for
Wells Fargo or Wells Fargo’s first opportunity to inspect Deliverables or Services provided by that Vendor
Personnel, whichever is later, Vendor will not charge Wells Fargo for the Deliverables or Services provided by the
unsatisfactory Vendor Personnel. Vendor will not assign any Vendor Personnel whose work Wells Fargo has
previously deemed unsatisfactory to provide Products or Services under the Master Agreement.
3. Location. Except for those Offshore Activities set forth in Section III.D.2 (Exceptions) below, Vendor warrants that
Vendor and Vendor Personnel will not provide Offshore Activities at a location that is not an Authorized Services Location.
Vendor Personnel’s provision of Offshore Activities at a location that is not an Authorized Services Location will be deemed a
material breach of the Master Agreement and (i) Wells Fargo, at its sole option, may immediately terminate for cause the Master
Agreement, in whole or in part, in written notice to Vendor; (ii) Wells Fargo may require that the Offshore Activities be provided
within the United States or from the Authorized Services Location(s) and Vendor will immediately comply with any such
requirement; or (iii) the Parties will execute an amendment to the Master Agreement to incorporate Wells Fargo’s requirements
with respect to the provision of Offshore Activities from a new Authorized Services Location. In addition, if Vendor subcontracts
the Offshore Activities or any portion thereof, and such subcontracting compels Wells Fargo, pursuant to the IS Standards (as
defined below), to perform additional Risk Assessment(s) (as defined below), Vendor will bear all reasonable costs associated
with conducting such Risk Assessments.
B. Non-Exclusive. The procurement of Products or Services is on a non-exclusive basis. Neither Wells Fargo nor its Affiliates
guarantees to Vendor any minimum amount of Products or Services, other than as may be agreed in a Transaction Document.
Subject to Vendor’s obligations within the Master Agreement, including Article VI (CONFIDENTIALITY), Vendor and
Vendor Personnel may contract to perform similar services for third parties during the term of the Master Agreement.
C. Non-Solicitation. Neither Party will directly solicit for employment any employee of the other Party performing Services under a
Transaction Document, during the term of the relevant Transaction Document or for three (3) months after the employee ceases
performing Services. If either Party directly solicits and then employs an employee of the other Party during this timeframe, the
Parties will agree to pay a recruitment fee, which fee will not exceed Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00) for any single hiring.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party is prohibited from employing an individual who approaches it about employment
opportunities or who applies for a position in response to a posting, employment advertisement or other general solicitation of
employment, or whose résumé is posted by the individual to an employment website that is searchable by a Party, whether during the
Transaction Document term or thereafter.
D. Offshore Activities.
** PROPRIETARY — INTERNAL USE ONLY ** 5 October 2012 Version
```
```col-md
1. Prior Approval Required. Subject to the terms of Section III.D.2 (Exceptions) below, the Vendor will not provide
Offshore Activities under the Master Agreement, whether directly or via any agent or subcontractor, without the prior
written consent of Wells Fargo. If Wells Fargo agrees to provide such consent, it will provide such consent by listing the
Authorized Services Location(s) in the Master Terms, the Attachment, or in the applicable Transaction Document where the
Offshore Activities are described. This consent may be withheld or withdrawn in Wells Fargo’s sole discretion.
2. Exceptions. The restrictions in Section III.D.1 (Prior Approval Required) will not apply to (a) Vendor’s efforts to
develop or modify its commercially available software at a location outside the United States, provided that the development
or modification is not specifically funded by Wells Fargo and does not include or reflect any Wells Fargo Confidential
Information; (b) Vendor’s manufacture of commercially available goods at a location outside the United States; or (c)
Vendor’s standard telephone or email technical support of its products or services from a location outside the United States
which does not require: (i) access to Wells Fargo Confidential Information, (ii) access to or connectivity with Wells Fargo’s
computing environments, or (iii) direct communication with any Wells Fargo customer or consumer.
E. Vendor Management. As a regulated entity, Wells Fargo is obligated to oversee its use of third-party service providers, to
assess and mitigate associated risks, and to provide information to its regulators to prove its use of third-party service providers
complies with Law and its regulatory obligations. To comply with such obligations, Wells Fargo may from time to time submit to
Vendor requests for information or documentation to prove the Products or Services are being provided in a manner consistent
with the Master Agreement (including periodic attestations regarding Vendor’s handling, maintenance, transportation, and
protection of Wells Fargo’s Confidential Information is in compliance with the IS Standards (as defined in Article VI
(SECURITY) below) or Vendor’s BCP obligations (pursuant to Section XIII.P (Business Continuity Plan) below). Wells
Fargo will endeavor to consolidate such requests to minimize the disruption to Vendor, and Vendor will comply with such
requests in a timely fashion.
F. Mandated Changes to Products and Services. If Law requires Wells Fargo to adopt specific standards with respect to its
service providers or to the Products or Services, the Vendor will conform to such standards (“Mandated Changes”). The Parties
will negotiate in good faith who will bear the costs associated with the Mandated Changes, unless Wells Fargo agrees to do so in
writing. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the costs associated with the Mandated Changes, Wells Fargo may terminate this
Master Agreement, in whole or in part, and such termination will be effective as of the date specified in a termination notice
provided by Wells Fargo. In such event, Wells Fargo will pay for all Products or Services provided up to the date of termination
that have been accepted by Wells Fargo (if any).
G. Anti-Corruption. If in the course of providing the Products or Services the Vendor acts as Wells Fargo’s intermediary or agent
with unrelated third parties (including individuals associated with U.S. and foreign governmental entities), or if the Vendor is
otherwise required to do so in a Transaction Document, then the Vendor represents and warrants to Wells Fargo that: (i) Vendor and
Vendor Personnel are currently complying and have at all times complied with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended (“FCPA"), and, to the extent applicable to Vendor either directly or because of Vendor’s engagement with Wells Fargo,
any other Law of any non-United States jurisdiction relating to anti-corruption or bribery, including the United Kingdom Bribery
Act of 2010, as amended (collectively with the FCPA, “Anti-Corruption Laws”); (ii) in accordance with the risks of its business
type and the locations in which it operates, Vendor has implemented an anti-corruption compliance program that includes internal
controls, policies and procedures, management oversight, monitoring, audit, governance, and training, to ensure compliance with
the Anti-Corruption Laws (“Anti-Corruption Program”); (iii) after Vendor’s reasonable inquiry, or alternatively, based on
compliance with its Anti-Corruption Program (which has been in existence for at least two years prior to the Effective Date of the
applicable Transaction Document), neither Vendor nor Vendor Personnel have during the two years prior to the Effective Date of
the applicable Transaction Document: (a) taken any direct or indirect action that would result in a violation of Anti-Corruption
Laws, including making, offering, or authorizing any bribe, facilitation or other payment, gift, entertainment, rebate, or any other
thing of value to any government official or employee, political party or official, or candidate, a public international organization,
a commercial entity or individual, whether tangible or intangible, to secure an improper advantage, or (b) been under an
administrative, civil, or criminal investigation, in connection with alleged or possible violations of Anti-Corruption Laws, nor (c)
received notice from, or made a voluntary disclosure to, any governmental entity, including the U.S. Department of Justice or the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding alleged or possible violations of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (iv) its
financial records are sufficiently accurate and complete to demonstrate its compliance with the Anti-Corruption Laws, represent
actual bona fide transactions, and have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices, including the maintenance
of adequate internal accounting controls. If Vendor suspects any breach of this provision or violation of applicable Anti-Corruption
Laws by Vendor Personnel, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Vendor will promptly notify Wells Fargo in writing of its
suspicions and cooperate with Wells Fargo in the resolution of issues raised.
H. Customer Interactions. If the Services or Products require Vendor Personnel to interact with customers or prospective
customers of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates, Vendor agrees to comply with the following requirements:

```
```col-md
1. Complaints. In handling complaints, Vendor will comply with Law and any Wells Fargo policy in place from time to
time for the affected Products and Services, which includes the obligation to notify the Wells Fargo designated contact set

investigate and resolve any such complaint. If there are changes to such policy during the term of the Master Agreement, Wells
Fargo will notify Vendor and Vendor will have a reasonable period of time to adjust its practices accordingly. Vendor will
cooperate with Wells Fargo and assist in Wells Fargo’s attempts to resolve the noted complaint and will provide to Wells
Fargo any requested information in relation to such complaint.
2. Do Not Call/Solicit Requests. If Vendor receives any oral or written requests or direction from customers or
prospective customers of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates to not: (a) receive marketing material by mail, (b) receive phone calls,
(c) receive emails, (d) receive contest solicitations, or (e) receive interactive ads, Vendor will communicate such requests to

with Vendor’s performance of Services, and (b) include the results of such survey results in its periodic evaluation of
Vendor’s performance under the Master Terms. If Wells Fargo informs Vendor of any material concerns raised by customers
based on the surveys, Vendor will promptly submit to Wells Fargo a plan for corrective action to address such concerns, and,
once approved by Wells Fargo, will promptly implement such plan.
IV. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
A. License to Wells Fargo Materials. During the term of a Transaction Document, Wells Fargo may provide Vendor with
Wells Fargo Materials for use in the provision of Products and Services, and for that term, Wells Fargo hereby grants to Vendor a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable license to use the Wells Fargo Materials solely in the provision of such Products
and Services. All right, title, and interest in and to the Wells Fargo Materials and any modifications to the Wells Fargo Materials,
including derivative works, are and will remain with Wells Fargo.
B. Ownership of Deliverables.
1. Wells Fargo’s Ownership. Subject to Vendor’s ownership of any Vendor Materials incorporated into the Deliverables,
Vendor and Wells Fargo agree that Wells Fargo is the owner of the Deliverables and all Intellectual Property Rights
therein. All Intellectual Property Rights in and to each item of the Deliverables will vest in Wells Fargo on the date such
Deliverables are created, conceived, reduced to practice (actually or constructively), or reduced to a tangible medium of
expression, whichever occurs first. Without limiting the foregoing, Vendor and Wells Fargo agree that if any
Deliverables are copyrightable and fall within the definition of a “work made for hire” under 17 U.S.C. §101 and
§201(b) in the United States or analogous provisions of other Law, such Deliverables will be considered “works made
for hire” and all copyrights and copyright registrations related to such Deliverables will be the sole and exclusive
property of Wells Fargo. For Deliverables created by Vendor related to the design or development of Wells Fargo
applications or systems not hosted by Vendor together the “Consulting Deliverables” or upon request by Wells Fargo,
Vendor will affix to all Deliverables an appropriate proprietary rights notice, which, in the absence of further direction
from Wells Fargo, will read as follows: “Copyright © 2012 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. All rights reserved” (other Wells
Fargo entities may be substituted, depending on the Wells Fargo entity procuring the Products or Services). If the year
of first publication of the work is other than 2012, Vendor will substitute the correct year of first publication. To the
extent that all Intellectual Property Rights in any Deliverables do not vest in Wells Fargo, Vendor hereby irrevocably
grants and assigns to Wells Fargo, without reservation, all of Vendor's worldwide ownership right, title, and interest in
and to all Deliverables and all present and future Intellectual Property Rights in such Deliverables, without compensation
other than as specified in the Transaction Document, and irrevocably waives all Intellectual Property Rights in and to all
Deliverables. Vendor agrees to execute documents and to assist Wells Fargo in every reasonable way requested by
Wells Fargo, at Wells Fargo’s expense, to protect and defend the Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Deliverables
as Wells Fargo deems appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor (on its own behalf as well as on behalf of
Vendor Personnel) hereby irrevocably appoints Wells Fargo as attorney in fact (coupled with an interest) to execute any
instruments for such purpose. The foregoing powers of attorney and the obligations to assist and execute will survive
termination of the Master Agreement for any reason. Vendor will include and enforce appropriate provisions in all
agreements with Vendor Personnel to enable Wells Fargo to acquire or exercise such rights. Vendor irrevocably agrees
not to directly or indirectly contest Wells Fargo’s ownership of the Deliverables and the corresponding Intellectual
Property Rights.
2. Further License. To the extent that any Vendor Materials are incorporated into the Deliverables, or Vendor or any
other third party retains any Intellectual Property Rights in any Deliverables, whether by contract or under any Law, and such
rights are not otherwise granted to Wells Fargo herein (“Retained Rights”), Vendor grants to Wells Fargo (or agrees to obtain
for Wells Fargo, at Vendor’s expense) a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, and nonexclusive license to make,

```
```col-md
have made, sell, use and disclose, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and
publicly display the materials that are the subject of the Retained Rights, with full rights to authorize others to do so, without
the obligation of Wells Fargo to identify, or to seek the consent of, such Vendor Personnel. Notwithstanding the foregoing for
any Deliverables related to hosting services, the Vendor grants to Wells Fargo (or agrees to obtain for Wells Fargo, at Vendor’s
expense) a royalty-free, worldwide, and nonexclusive license to make, have made, sell, use, and disclose, reproduce, modify,
prepare derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display the materials that are the subject of the
Retained Rights while said hosting services are obtained by Wells Fargo from the Vendor.
3. Waiver. Further, if, by operation of Law, Vendor Personnel are deemed to retain any right in any Deliverables or
Intellectual Property Rights in such Deliverables, Vendor hereby waives, and agrees to cause Vendor Personnel to waive, all
such rights. However, if waiver is not permissible under Law or does not grant to Wells Fargo the exclusive right to make,
have made, sell, use, and disclose, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform or publicly
display the Deliverables, Vendor hereby agrees not to assert, and to compel Vendor Personnel to refrain from asserting,
claims with regard to any Retained Rights, in any manner whatsoever.
C. Third-Party Intellectual Property. If any third-party intellectual property is to be incorporated within the Deliverables,
Vendor will identify in reasonable detail such intellectual property in the Transaction Document prior to any such incorporation.
Vendor will be responsible for supplying such intellectual property and the appropriate licenses thereto, per Section IV.B
(Ownership of Deliverables), above. Any third-party intellectual property not originally listed in the applicable Transaction
Document will require Wells Fargo’s written consent before incorporation within a Deliverable; such consent may be withheld at
Wells Fargo’s sole discretion. At Wells Fargo’s request, the Vendor will provide copies of all applicable licenses and other
agreements pertaining to the third-party intellectual property. Any incorporation of third-party intellectual property requires the
prior written consent of the authorized executive within the affected Wells Fargo line of business.
V. PRICING AND PAYMENT
A. Payment Terms.
1. General. The Vendor will invoice Wells Fargo for Products or Services at the rates set forth in the applicable Transaction
Document. Vendor will pass through any third-party Services or Products without an increase in cost or mark-up to Wells
Fargo. Unless a different currency is set forth in a Transaction Document, all amounts invoiced will be in United States
Dollars unless indicated to the contrary in a Transaction Document.
2. Invoices. The Vendor will provide invoices to Wells Fargo within thirty (30) days of the provision of Products or Services to
Wells Fargo, unless otherwise specified in a Transaction Document, and will comply with all invoicing procedures set forth
in the Transaction Document or reasonably requested by Wells Fargo. Vendor will ensure all invoices identify the
Transaction Document to which the invoice relates as well as the associated accounting unit (AU) number, are accurate and
correspond to the compensation agreed-upon in the Transaction Document and are delivered to the proper individual or
business unit.
3. Payment. Wells Fargo will pay all undisputed amounts set forth in a compliant invoice within thirty (30) days of its
receipt; provided, however, that Wells Fargo may return non-compliant invoices to Vendor and Wells Fargo will not be liable
for payment until receipt of a compliant invoice. Notwithstanding any such noncompliance, or any disputed amount on an
invoice, the Vendor will continue to perform all its obligations under the Master Agreement and the applicable Transaction
Document. Any disputed portion of an invoice will be resolved in accordance with Section XIII.K (Dispute Resolution).
Once the dispute is resolved, Wells Fargo will pay any amount owing to Vendor within forty-five (45) days after the final
resolution and Vendor’s submission of a compliant invoice. No payment made by Wells Fargo will be considered as Wells
Fargo’s acceptance of satisfactory performance of Vendor’s obligations or of substandard or non-conforming Products or
Services, or as a release to Vendor of its full responsibility under the Master Agreement. Vendor’s late submission of
invoices, especially following a calendar year, may result in significant delays in payment of those invoices by Wells Fargo,
and in no event will Wells Fargo be liable for the payment of any invoice received more than one hundred and twenty (120)
days after accrual of the charges covered by such invoice.
B. Intentionally Left Blank.
C. Rates and Overtime. Except as provided in a Transaction Document, the compensation rates for a Transaction Document will
be fixed for the duration of that Transaction Document. To the extent that the Transaction Document provides for an increase in
compensation rates, Vendor may implement such increase not more than once in any twelve (12) month period, and then by not more
than three (3) percent over the rate in effect at the time of the increase, and only after Vendor gives Wells Fargo at least ninety (90)
days’ prior written notice of such rate increase. Vendor will comply with all Law with respect to the payment of fees (including
overtime) to Vendor Personnel, but Vendor will not charge Wells Fargo additional amounts for overtime unless the applicable
Attachment or related Transaction Document provides for a specific overtime rate, and Wells Fargo approves each instance of

```
```col-md
overtime in writing, in advance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary regarding service levels or performance standards
relating to the Products or Services, the Vendor will not pay volume-based or other incentives to Vendor Personnel in a manner that
encourages undue haste or lack of diligence regarding the Products or Services provided.
D. Expenses. Unless specified in an Attachment or Transaction Document, and authorized by Wells Fargo in advance, Wells
Fargo will not reimburse Vendor for expenses incurred by Vendor. To the extent that Wells Fargo agrees to reimburse expenses
in an Attachment or Transaction Document, such expenses will be reimbursed (i) in accordance with the Approved Expense
Reimbursement Policy set forth below; and (ii) as reflected in a compliant invoice.
Approved Expense Reimbursement Policy:
Vendor will invoice fees for out-of-pocket expenses to Wells Fargo on a monthly basis.
Itemization and receipts are required for all expenses.

4, International. In the event that the Services described above are to be performed by individuals located outside the
United States, Wells Fargo may impose different background check requirements on such individuals to ensure that the
Vendor obtains a background check that most closely resembles the check described in this provision, and which is consistent
with the Law in such non-U.S. jurisdiction(s); these requirements will be communicated to Vendor. Upon request, Vendor
will provide written evidence that all Vendor Personnel providing the Services described above have undergone criminal
background checks and are eligible to provide such Services (but not the actual results of the checks themselves).

right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate all or part of this Master Agreement immediately, without further
liability.

Party against amounts it is otherwise owed. Further, in any Dispute, the prevailing Party is entitled to recover its reasonable legal
counsel fees (including, if@pplicable, reasonable charges for in-house counsel), court costs and other legal expenses from the nonprevailing Party.

to, the Master Agreement (“Dispute”) will be resolved expeditiously, amicably, and at the level within each Party's organization
most knowledgeable about the Dispute, in accordance with the procedures outlined below. The Parties do not intend for the
procedures outlined below to supplant the routine handling of inquiries and complaints through informal contact with customer
service representatives or other designated personnel of the Parties. Throughout the Dispute resolution process, each Party will
continue to perform its obligations under the Master Agreement.
1. General. The complaining party's representative will notify the other party’s representative in writing of the Dispute,

Master Agreement
Professional Services Attachment
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES GENERALLY
A. Professional Services
1. ‘Professional Services” means technical, consulting, training, configuration, development,
customization, installation or other Services, but not including generally available maintenance
services for specific Products (e.g., hardware or software) procured by Wells Fargo under a separate
Attachment. All Professional Services provided by Vendor under this PSA will be set forth in a
Transaction Document. For this PSA, the applicable Transaction Document is a statement of work
(“SOW”) or a purchase order (“PO”).
2. Vendor agrees that it will not perform any Professional Services without a SOW signed by Wells Fargo
and Vendor, or a PO issued by Wells Fargo authorized personnel to Vendor. To modify a SOW, Wells
Fargo will request a written estimate from Vendor (a “Change Request”). Within five (5) days
following receipt of the Change Request, Vendor will deliver to Wells Fargo a written estimate
detailing any impact such change(s) will have on applicable deadlines or amounts to be charged (a
“Change Request Estimate”). If Wells Fargo elects to pro¢¢ed with such change on the basis of such
Change Request Estimate, the Parties will enter into a written amendment to the SOW.
3. Vendor will notify all Vendor Personnel who havé\Wells Fargo network access and are issued a
LAN id, and primarily perform Services inside,&Wells Fargo facility that, during the time period
they are performing Services, they must notpurchase, directly or indirectly, any residential or
commercial property that is owned by America’s Servicing Company, or Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or
its division Premier Asset Services (wayW.pasreo.com), or is subject to any foreclosure action or
short-sale process by such entities. Exceptions may be sought, but are in Wells Fargo’s sole
discretion. If any such Vendor Personnel breaches this prohibition, Vendor will immediately remove
such individual from performing Services.
B. Service Level Agreements
The SOW will include service-level agreements with respect to the Professional Services, including without
limitation, quality, timeliness, or accuracy of the Professional Services, or related reporting obligations
(“SLAs”). If either Patty becomes aware of any non-conformance of the Professional Services or any
Deliverables with respect to the SLAs, Vendor, at its own cost and expense, will promptly correct the noted
non-conformities,or re-perform the Professional Services, in accordance with the applicable SLAs. Ifa
SOW specifies that liquidated damages may be awarded for Vendor’s failure to meet any SLAs, the Parties
agree that these liquidated damages will not be construed as a penalty, and are a reasonable estimate of the
damages to be suffered for any stated failure of performance. Or, if the SOW does not specify liquidated
damages for Vendor’s failure to meet the SLAs, then Wells Fargo may demand a refund of all amounts paid
by Wells Fargo with respect to the non-conforming Professional Services or Deliverables.
PROCUREMENT PURSUANT TO TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Each Transaction Document will describe the Professional Services to be performed, the compensation
therefor, and any other details related to such engagement. Exhibit 1 to this PSA provides an exemplar
template for a SOW, which may be modified for the specific Professional Services to be provided.

IH. USE OF SPECIFIC VENDOR PERSONNEL
If Wells Fargo requests that a specific individual or entity perform Professional Services for Wells Fargo as
Vendor Personnel, Wells Fargo will advise Vendor in writing of the name of such individual or entity proposed
to be assigned to Wells Fargo prior to the execution of an SOW or issuance of the PO. Vendor will use
commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate any such request.
IV. ACCEPTANCE
A. Acceptance Period.
If Vendor is providing Deliverables under a Transaction Document, Wells Fargo will have the right to
evaluate the Professional Services and any Deliverables for compliance with the terms of the Master
Agreement, including the specifications and acceptance criteria described in the Transaction Document.
Wells Fargo will provide a written acceptance or rejection to Vendor within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Professional Services or the Deliverables (“Acceptance Period”), unless otherwise set forth
in the Transaction Document. The acceptance date for those Professional Services or Deliverables shall be
the first business day following the date upon which Wells Fargo accepts the Professional Services or
Deliverables. Wells Fargo’s failure to respond within such timeframe will not,be deemed to be its
acceptance of the Professional Services rendered or Deliverables furnished.
B. Non-Conformance.
If Wells Fargo rejects the Professional Services or any Deliverables‘for not conforming to the acceptance
criteria specified in the Transaction Document, Wells Fargo wilknotify Vendor in writing, describing the
reasons for the rejection. Vendor, at its own cost, will correct;the non-conformities within ten (10) days
following receipt of Wells Fargo’s rejection notice, and will provide conforming Professional Services or
Deliverables to Wells Fargo. Upon receipt, Wells Fargo will have thirty (30) days to re-evaluate and accept
or reject the corrected Professional Services or Deliverables, in writing. Vendor will assist Wells Fargo, at
Vendor’s cost, in conducting this additional testing of the Professional Services or Deliverables, If Vendor
is unable to correct the non-conformities withia the specified time, Wells Fargo may: (i) immediately
terminate all or part of the applicable Transaction Document and any interdependent Transaction Document,
and receive a refund of all monies paid to date thereunder; (ii) by written notice, extend the Acceptance
Period or permit additional iterations of review of corrected Professional Services or Deliverables; or (iii)
accept the non-conforming Professional Services or Deliverables with an appropriate pro-rata reduction in
price/fees. Notwithstanding theforegoing, election by Wells Fargo of one of the foregoing remedies will
not affect Wells Fargo’s rightto terminate all or part of the applicable Transaction Document or any
interdependent TransactionDocuments, or to seek a refund of the amounts paid by Wells Fargo in respect of
Professional Services of Deliverables or any interdependent Transaction Documents rejected and not
subsequently corrected:
