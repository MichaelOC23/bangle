STATEMENT OF WORK 15:
Allspring File Transfer Solution  
This Statement of Work (“SOW’) is entered into between Markit On Demand, Inc. (“Markit”) and Wells Fargo
Investment Institute, Inc. (“Wells Fargo” or “Client”) pursuant to and incorporating by reference all terms and
conditions of the Master Agreement between Markit and Client dated May 7, 2013 (the “Agreement”).  
This SOW constitutes a separate agreement between Markit and Client for the services described herein. The parties
agree that this SOW and the services provided hereunder are subject to the terms and conditions-of the Agreement,
incorporated into this SOW by reference. In case of inconsistency between the terms of the Agreement and the terms
of this SOW, the terms of this SOW shall prevail. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this SOW shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Agreement.  
This SOW commences on March 1, 2023 (“Effective Date’).  
1 Project Description
1.1 Customized Solution  
Markit will design, build and implement tasks to allow Wells Fargo to fetch and deliver Allspring-entitled documents
to Allspring Global Investments (“Allspring”) FTP service after publication in the Wells Fargo research center. Wells
Fargo hereby acknowledges that with respect to any documents shared with Allspring in accordance with this SOW,
it is responsible and liable for any non-compliance with, or breach of any of the terms of the Agreement or this SOW
(including but not limited to confidentiality and pay of any feescif applicable) by Allspring.  
As part of the Customized Solution, Client’s marketing team will be able to distinguish Allspring-entitled research
reports using the entitlement section of the publishing tool (selecting ‘WFAM’ and selecting the ‘Client Approved’
distribution classification).  
The Markit Document Management System willNeverage the ‘WFAM’ entitlement to expose the universe of reports
that must be delivered to Allspring, which will\be delivered to the Allspring FTP via a task. Markit will also add logic
to display a message and block publication if the following criteria are not met:  
a) If ‘WFAM’ check box is selectedsin the entitlements section of the Research Center Publishing Tool, a report
cannot be published unless.distribution classification is ‘Client Approved’.  
The display message will inform the publisher why they are unable to publish and will include an ‘OKAY’ button that
will return them to the form to,move forward with the proper workflow.  
Upon publication, the Markit task will fetch reports based on those criteria and deliver them via FTP to Allspring,
utilizing the following. service details from Allspring:  
a) Server Name
b) User Name
c) Password  
d) \Type of Authentication (as applicable)  
2 Schedule  
Markit expects but does not warrant the full construction of the Customized Solution to take between 3-6 weeks.  
3. Term  
This SOW shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in effect for one (1) year (“Initial Term”). The Initial
Term shall renew for successive renewal terms of one (1) year each (“Renewal Term’), unless either party notifies
