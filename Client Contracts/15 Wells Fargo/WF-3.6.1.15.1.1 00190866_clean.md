language is added within that Section:  
“Markit will ensure that the Archive Solution will be available at least 99.9% of the time as measured over each
calendar month during the Term (“Uptime Requirement”).  
Monitoring Approach: Markit willapply a monitor to the Archive Solution in order to determine Uptime. The
Archive Solution will be monitored continuously from more than one location outside of Markit’s network on a
round-robin basis at least-once per minute. The Archive Solution fails a monitoring test if two monitoring
locations fail to access the-Archive Solution in two successive tries from each monitoring location.  
Uptime Calculation=-Uptime will be calculated at the end of each month based on data provided by Markit’s
external monitoring provider. The Archive Solution will be considered to be unavailable from the time of the first
failure until the first subsequent success. All such intervals will be reviewed and validated by Markit. Uptime will
then be calculated as the sum of all periods during which the page was available during the calendar month,
divided by)the total time in the month. One percentage will be calculated per month. Scheduled Maintenance
as described below shall not be included for purposes of calculating Uptime.  
Exclusions: Any failure due to an outage of a Third Party, defined as any service, data or content provider that
is neither the Client nor Markit, will be excluded from the Uptime calculation.  
Credits: If, in any calendar month during the Term, Uptime falls below the Uptime Requirement, Markit will grant
Client a credit for that month based on the table set forth below, calculated as follows: the percentage set forth
in the table below multiplied by the Service Fees due for the same period. The availability of service credits will
not limit any other rights of Client under this agreement.
