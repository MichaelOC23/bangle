other online information pertinent to a Schedule presented by JPMC to Supplier online (“Electronic Schedule”)
before assenting electronically to perform the Services. In order to signify assent’by electronic signature to the
terms for performance of Services specified in an Electronic Schedule, Suppliér’s authorized employee already
identified as logged into the Electronic Schedule Process will click the designated “Accept” button for the box
containing the following Electronic Schedule Process acceptance language:

Personnel is not in the best interests of JPMC, JPMC may request in writing that the individual be replaced.
Within five days after Supplier’s receipt of that request, Supplier will remove that individual from JPMC’s
account and all JPMorgan Chase & Co. facilities and replace that individual with Supplier Personnel of suitable
ability and qualifications at no additional cost to JPMC. JPMC will not be invoiced for any work performed by

INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS EXHIBIT  
The term “should” in these Information Security Requirements means that Supplier will use commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the stated control requirement, and will document those efforts, including the
rationale for deviation. This documentation may be reviewed by Auditors to assess the merit of the rationale.

unauthorized traffic passes through the security gateway even if the security
gateway cannot communicate with an associated management station.  
4. Supplier will segregate networks and control requirements for access
between networks to ensure appropriate authorized and controlled
