1. AGREEMENT STRUCTURE.
Ll Schedules.  
The parties will agree on the goods, licensed materials or services that Supplier will provide
(each, a “Deliverable”), the prices that JPMC will pay and other transaction-specific terms through
schedules to this Agreement (“Schedules”). Each Schedule will either be (a) a separate document that is
signed by both JPMC and Supplier; or (b) a JPMC purchase order, electronic (“Procure to Pay”) or
otherwise, that is accepted by Supplier and references either this Agreement or a Schedule. (Each
Schedule will be deemed to incorporate all of the terms of this Agreement. If a term in a Schedule
conflicts with a term in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will prevail unless the Schedule
specifically states that the term in the Schedule will prevail. If a term in a Schedule conflicts with a term
in a purchase order that is issued pursuant to that Schedule, the provisions of the Schedtwle will prevail
unless the purchase order specifically states that the term in the purchase order shall prevail and Supplier
accepts the purchase order. If terms in this Agreement conflict, the term most closely describing the type
of transaction giving rise to the issue will prevail. The terms of this Agreement will supersede any clickwrap, shrink-wrap or browse-wrap agreements or any other document containing terms and conditions
related to the Deliverables as well as any conflicting provision inyany purchase order or order
acknowledgement unless such agreements, terms and conditions,\that purchase order or order
acknowledgement (each, a “Conflicting Document”) is signed by.both parties and the provision in the
Conflicting Document indicates with specificity which provisiominthis Agreement it takes precedence
over.  
1.2 Entities Entering into Schedules.  
JPMC or any of its Affiliates (each, a “JRMC Entity” and collectively, “JPMorgan Chase &
Co.”) may enter into Schedules. The term “Affiliate” means an entity owned by, controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with, directly or@ndirectly, a party. For this purpose, one entity “controls”
another entity if it has the power to direct.the management and policies of the other entity (for example,
through the ownership of voting securities.or other equity interest, representation on its board of directors
or other governing body, or by contract): The benefits of any Schedule extend to the JPMC Entity that
signs the Schedule and to other JPMC Entities, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners and
divested companies (each, a “Recipient”).  
13 Each Schedules a Separate Agreement.  
Each Scheduléwill be a separate agreement between Supplier and the JPMC Entity that signs the
Schedule. All subsequent references to “JPMC” in this Agreement will be deemed references to the
JPMC Entity that signed the Schedule. Only the JPMC Entity that signs a Schedule will be liable for such
JPMC Entity’s-obligations under that Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or any Schedule, in no event will any JPMC Entity that is a bank be deemed to be a
guarantor of, or otherwise liable for, any performance or payment obligation of any other JPMC Entity in
connection with this Agreement or any Schedule.  
1.4 Schedule Term.  
A Schedule may state a term for that Schedule (the “Schedule Term”). A Schedule that does not
state a Schedule Term will be effective from its effective date until the termination of this Agreement,
unless otherwise terminated in accordance with this Agreement or the Schedule. Following the Schedule
Term stated in any Schedule, JPMC will have the right to renew the Schedule Term with respect to
services for up to five additional one year renewal terms, provided that Suppiier does not provide JPMC

hereunder into taxable and nontaxable categories to minimize to the extent legally permissible, sales,
use, value added and excise taxes. Where taxable and nontaxable items must be separated on the

classification, Supplier will so separately state the portion of the goods or services and associated
charges and fees which are (i) subject to sales, use, value-added or excise taxes, and (ii) not.subject to
any sales, use, value-added or excise taxes. Supplier’s invoice will state the total amount of sales, use,

challenging the potential assessment. If-cither party is assessed a deficiency for taxes, which are the
responsibility of the other party pursuant to this Agreement, the assessed party will make a reasonable
effort to notify the responsible partyof such assessment. Each party also will have the right to
challenge the imposition of taxes, for which it is financially responsible under this Agreement or if

the other party to challenge ‘the imposition of any tax, such request will not be unreasonably denied,
providing that the requestitig party will be responsible for all fines, penalties, interest, additions to
taxes or similar liabilities imposed in connection therewith plus any legal fees and other expenses
related to such challenge. Each party will be entitled to any tax refunds or rebates granted, including
any interest paid‘thereon, to the extent such refunds or rebates are of taxes that were paid by it.
