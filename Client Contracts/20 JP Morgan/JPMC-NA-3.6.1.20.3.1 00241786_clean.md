“Workaround” means a solution that resolves a problem without decreasing System features, functionality
or performance or resulting in an added burden or expense to JPMC.  
2. RESPONSE AND ESCALATION SERVICES.  
Supplier will respond to any and all Incidents, requests for maintenance, support services escalations, or
queries via its Tier 1 Support Center (“Tier 1”) 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. Tier 1
can be reached at MOD-NOC @ihsmarkit.com or +1 .303.583.4308. Response to any escalation will be from
a technical incident responder in the Tier 1 and not an automated reply.  
Upon notice of any Incident related to any part of the services provided by Supplier to JPMC, Tier 1
personnel will initiate the Incident Response procedure and provide the Supplier tracking ticket number
within 15 minutes. Tier 1 will respond within 15 minutes of receiving notice of the Incident; regardless of
severity level.  
For all issues classified “Sev 1 —Total Outage” or “Sev 2 — Major Outage” as per Table 2 below, Tier 1 will
contact an Incident Manager in conjunction with creating the initial tracking ticket. The Incident Manager
will join the investigation within 15 minutes during Supplier’s core support hours (24 hours a day, Monday
through Friday, excluding holidays) and within 30 minutes otherwise (including weekends). The Incident
Manager will provide JPMC with proactive status updates via email.orphone.  
Supplier will respond to Incidents, requests for maintenance, support service escalations, or queries from
JPMC or approved representatives of JPMC only. Should an End User contact Supplier directly, Supplier
will (i) instruct the End User to contact JPMC directly and\(ii) request the Project Manager to follow up
with JPMC.  
Incident Severity Determination: Supplier will classify escalation severity level for any Incident (whether
reported by JPMC or via Supplier internal monitoring alert) according to the criteria in Table 2.  
If, as a result of the ongoing investigation, severity is determined to be lower or higher than initially
observed, Supplier will reset severity level and response expectations.  
Incidents caused by Supplier third.party vendors (contracting directly with Supplier) will be classified and
handled the same as Supplier-related issues.  
3. SERVICE LEVELS  
System Operation Service Levels. Supplier will provide the Services to JPMC so that all of the quantitative
measurements-set-forth in the first column of Table 1 below (each, a “Metric’’) satisfy the corresponding
specifications.set forth in the second column of Table 1 below (each, a “Standard”). If any Metric does not
satisfy one‘or more of its corresponding Standards, then JPMC will be entitled to receive the corresponding
remedy(i¢s) set forth in the third column of Table 1 (each, a “Remedy”).  
Table 1. Service Levels for System Operation  
Metric Standard Remedy  
Availability -— Percentage of | 99.89% + of each Measurement | One Credit for each 0.5  
Measurement Intervals that are | Period percentage points below Standard

Response and Resolution Times. Supplier will respond to and resolve problems so as to meet all of, the
Service Levels in Table 2 below. If Supplier does not satisfy one or more of those Service Levels, JPMC
will be entitled to receive the credits specified below. (For example, if Supplier provides a Werkaround
for a Priority 1 problem in eight hours, Supplier will owe four Credits. Such credits will be deemed to be
price reductions reflecting a diminution in the value of such services as a result of the failure to meet the
service levels rather than liquidated damages or a penalty. Any failure by Supplier to\meet any service
levels rather than liquidated damages or a penalty. Any failure by Supplier to meet any’service level two or
more times in any six-month period will be deemed a material breach by Supplier that-is incapable of cure.  
Notice of Delayed Resolution. If Supplier does not resolve a problem within the Resolution Times listed
in Table 2 below, Supplier will immediately notify JPMC. This notice will include (i) a reasonable
explanation for the delay and (ii) a good faith schedule and plan fon correction. This notice will not
constitute an excuse or waiver of performance. Supplier will keep-JPMC informed of the progress of its
efforts to resolve Severity 1 or 2 problems at appropriate intervals or'as requested by JPMC.  
4. Availability Requirement  
Supplier will ensure that the System will be available at least 99.9% of the time as measured over each
calendar month during the Term (“Availability Requirement”).  
Monitoring Approach: Supplier will choos¢One or more pages of the System to monitor in order to
determine Availability. Page selections will be reviewed with the JPMC to ensure appropriateness. Each
page will be monitored continuously frommore than one location outside of Supplier’s network on a roundrobin basis at least once per minute. A page fails a monitoring test if two monitoring locations fail to access
a page in two successive tries fromeach monitoring location.  
Availability Calculation: Availability will be calculated at the end of each month based on data provided
by Supplier’s external monitoring provider. A page will be considered to be unavailable from the time of
the first failure until the,first subsequent success. All such intervals will be reviewed and validated by
Supplier. Availability will then be calculated as the sum of all periods during which the page was available
during the calendar-month, divided by the total time in the month. One percentage will be calculated per
month.  
Exclusions:“Any failure due to an outage of a Third Party will be excluded from the Availability calculation.
5. System Response Time Requirement  
Supplier will ensure that the Customized Solution meets specific targets as set forth below (“System
Response Time Requirement”).  
Monitoring Approach: Each request will be continuously monitored from more than one location outside
of Supplier’s network on a round-robin basis at least once per minute. System response time will be

recorded by Supplier’s external monitoring provider. System response times will not be considered for
failures, as failures are addressed by the Uptime Requirement.  
System Response Time Calculation: Response Time will be calculated at the end of each month based on
data provided by Supplier’s external monitoring provider. The percentage of requests that satisfy the
Response Time Requirement shall be the number that completed in less than the associated target time
divided by the total number of requests that completed successfully. One percentage will be calculated for
each request during the month.  
Exclusions: Any impact due to a Third Party will be excluded from the System Response Time Requirement
calculation.  
Credits: If, in any calendar month during the Term, Supplier falls below the System Response Time
Requirement, then without limiting any other right or remedy to which Client may be entitled as a result of
such System Response Time, whether under this Agreement, at law or in equity, Supplier will grant JPMC
a proportional credit for that month based on the table set forth below, calculated ayfollows: the percentage
set forth in the table below multiplied by the Service Fees due to for the same-period. If multiple requests
fail to meet the System Response Time Requirement in a given month, the total Credits shall be the largest
of the individual Credits.

Time Target shall be:

Levels in the Response and Resolution Schedule above. The Incident(s) will be
categorized by JPMC in accordance with the Severity definitions defined in Section 9 \If
Supplier disagrees with JPMC’s severity categorization, then Supplier shall notify, PMC
and the dispute will be resolved by management review at the earliest opportunity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, JPMC shall have final determination of severity
categorization. Any objection made by Supplier shall not result in Supplier’ sobligation to
meet the time requirements as set forth in the Section 5 above, however those requirements
