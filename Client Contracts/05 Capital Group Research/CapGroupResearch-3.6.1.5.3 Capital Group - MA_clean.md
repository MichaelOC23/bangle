Problems with the Customized Solution will be classified according to the impact that they have on Client.  
Level One —  
Critical Impact/Failure: A problem that threatens Client’s key business operations. This would include greater than 20 second load time forPreview Pages.
Examples include: Client’s entire site is nonfunctional; Client’s key services are unavailable; and Client’s APIs are unavailable.  
Level Two —

2 Availability  
“Availability” means the amount of time in a calendar month during which the MOD Services are available. “Available Hours” means all times of day and
night, 24 hour a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, excluding any Scheduled Maintenance Period.  
“Uptime Percentage” shall be calculated by taking the total number of minutes within the Available Hours in a given month, subtracting the total number of
minutes during which the MOD Services are not available, and dividing by the total number of minutes within the Available Hours. For example, in a thirty
day month, there are 43,200 minutes, assuming no Scheduled Maintenance Period. If during this month, the MOD Services are unavailable for a total of 432
minutes, the Uptime Percentage would be 99% (43,200-432/43.200).  
The following shall be excluded for purposes of Uptime Percentage calculations:  
a) Any outage that occurs during a Scheduled Maintenance Period. MOD may be required to perform system-wide maintenance, duritgywhich period the
Customized Solution may be inaccessible (each such period, a “Scheduled Maintenance Period”). Any such Scheduled Maintenance Period shall occur
no more often than once per month, on a designated Sunday between midnight and 4 a.m. Eastern Time. MOD will provide Clint With at least five (5)
business days’ notice via email of any Scheduled Maintenance Period.  
b) Any failure due to any outage of a third party monitoring provider, third party data provider or any other type of third paitvendor contracted by Client.  
3 Monitoring  
For purposes of determining the Uptime Percentage, MOD and Client will mutually agree on a subset of pages to ntertitor. Each page will be monitored by an
independent third party monitoring provider engaged by MOD from more than one location outside of MODs fetWwork on a round-robin basis at least once
every five minutes. A page fails a monitoring test if two monitoring locations fail to access a page in two succe¥sive tries from each monitoring location. On
a monthly basis, MOD shall provide Client a written report which contains the results of the monitoring.  
4 Remedies  
MOD shall provide the following remedies for failure to meet the specified Uptime Percentage:  
Uptime Credit Action  
Less than 5% of MOD shall devote resources to review  
99.80% monthly and assess the cause of the problem
hosting fees and shall provide Client with written
