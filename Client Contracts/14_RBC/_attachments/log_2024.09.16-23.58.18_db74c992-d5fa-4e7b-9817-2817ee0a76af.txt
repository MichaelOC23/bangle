Royal Bank of Canada

RBC Contract No: CTR021732

AMENDMENT #1 TO STATEMENT OF WORK #57
Emerald MVP

This Amendment #1 to Statement of Work #57: Hosting and Dedicated Team (“SOW”) (RBC Contract No:
CTRO021732) is entered into as of March 4, 2023 by and between Royal Bank of Canada (“Client” or “RBC”) and
Markit Digital North America Inc. (successor in title and rights to Markit Digital On Demand, Inc.) (“Markit
Digital”). Client and Markit Digital are parties to the SOW (RBC Contract No: CTR021732), effective December 1,
2022. Except as provided herein, all other terms of the SOW shall remain unchanged.

This amendment is for the addition of two new instances of a Monthly Service Fee for a defined period (items F, G),
a one-time fee (item H), and the increase to an existing, recurring Monthly Service Fee (amended item A) . These
fees are to support the design, development and maintenance and support of the Emerald MVP, the scope for which
is outlined in the Appendix.

Accordingly, the parties agree that the following language shall be amended:
In section 6, the following items are added:

F. $315,000 USD/month for the Integration Team of seventeen and a half (17.5) FTEs for the period starting
March 4, 2023 and ending August 3, 2023. This is to support Emerald MVP phase 1, targeting an August 4,
2023 delivery to the acceptance environment.

Client may elect to increase or decrease the number of resources on the Integration Team by providing
Markit Digital 60 days’ written notice; email shall suffice for this purpose. Should RBC wish to increase
the number of Integration Team resources, the fee for incremental Integration Team members above the
original number of FTEs per Section 6 shall be $18,000 per FTE per month, regardless of the number of
FTEs. Should RBC wish to decrease the number of Integration Team resources, the savings shall be
$18,000 per FTE per month.

G. $180,000 USD/month for the Deployment Team of ten (10) FTEs for the period of three (3) months from
August 4, 2023 to November 3, 2023. This is to support Emerald MVP phase 2, targeting a November 3,

2023 delivery to the acceptance environment

Client may elect to increase or decrease the number of resources on the Deployment Team by providing

Markit Digital 60 days’ written notice; email shall suffice for this purpose. Should RBC wish to increase
the number of Deployment Team resources, the fee for incremental Deployment Team members above the
original number of FTEs per Section 6 shall be $18,000 per FTE per month, regardless of the number of
FTEs. Should RBC wish to decrease the number of Deployment Team resources, the savings shall be
$18,000 per FTE per month.

H. A one-time fee of $215,000 USD payable on or before December 31, 2023. This a negotiated amount to
offset the reduction in additional monthly fees for Hosting Services from $28,000 USD per month to
$15,000 USD per month upon the Acceptance Date of Emerald MVP phase | (as per item A) through the
end of the current term.

Page 1 of 5

effective on Acceptance Date of Emerald MVP phase 1. Accordingly, the verbiage in item A of section 6 shall be
removed and replaced with the following:

A. The monthly Hosting Services (as described below and in Section 10) for all RBC DI Services and RBC
