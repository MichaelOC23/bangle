selected in sequence.  
3.2 Uptime Calculation: A Monitored Page is deemed Unavailable if it fails for two (2) successive requests from each of any two Locations.
The period of Unavailability for each Monitored Page begins with the first such failed request and ends when the Monitored Page
has no longer failed for two (2) successive requests from each of any two Locations. Following the end of each calendar month,
Markit will calculate the Uptime for that.calendar month. One Uptime percentage will be calculated per month. Scheduled
Maintenance as described in Section 6.1 below shall not be included for purposes of calculating Uptime.  
3.3 Exclusions: Any failure due to an outage of a Third Party will be excluded from the Uptime calculation.  
3.4 Credits: If, in any calendar month‘during the Term, Uptime falls below the Uptime Requirement, Markit will grant Client a credit for
that month based on the table ‘set forth below, calculated as follows: the percentage set forth in the table below multiplied by the
Service Fees due for the same period.  
Service Level Metric Uptime Credit  
Uptime) 99.80-99.89% 5%

Requirement’).  
4.1 _\“Response Time” means the HTML download time for each of the page components (“Components”) for Monitored Pages, excluding
advertisements and third party content  
4.2 Monitoring Approach: Each request will be continuously monitored from more than one location outside of Markit’s network on a
round-robin basis as described in section 3.1. Response Time will be recorded by Markit’s external monitoring provider. Response
times will not be considered where a request fails to complete successfully, as failures are addressed by the Uptime Requirement.  
4.3 Response Time Calculation: Response Time Percentage will be calculated at the end of each month based on data provided by
Markit’s external monitoring provider. The “Response Time Percentage” shall be the number that completed in less than 2 seconds
divided by the total number of requests that completed successfully.
