4 — Low: Our Production Support teams will never set a Client reported issue to 4-Low. The majority of incidents
that would be considered Low will be handled personally by the Project Manager of assigned to the site in
question. Project Management will work with the Client directly to determine what aesthetié change is necessary
to meet the needs of the Client/user base.  
2.6.2. The MOD Incident Manager will be available to join a bridge line or other such cooperative coordination effort to
resolve a Critical incident. . If a Critical incident cannot be resolved within the timeframe communicated by the
MOD Incident Manager, the Client may escalate via the MOD Incident Manager to request a senior technicat
representative join the bridge line within 30 minutes during core business hours and 1 hour ail other times. MOD
will also proactively initiate conference calls or “Bridge” lines where its determined by MOD first that the
resolution depends on a coordinated effort with The Client.  
2.7, MOD shall provide Client with notice of any issue affecting the performance of the Customized Solution, within 15
minutes of which MOD becomes aware, even if MOD believes such \issue to be the result of an act or omission of any
other Third Party, and shall cooperate in partnership with Client\and Third Party to restore the solution to normal
functionality and service in a timely manner. MOD is not resporisible for any problem that MOD identifies as being due
to a data or content provider (Third Party). Outages or Performance concems determined to be caused by any Third
Party are not subject to the Credits defined in this SLA.  
3. Uptime Requirement: MOD wilt ensure that the MOD Services will be Available at least 99.9% of the time measured over
each calendar month during the Term, excluding Schsduled Maintenance (“Uptime Requirement’).  
3.1. Monitoring Approach: MOD will choose one orfmore pages to monitor to determine Uptime. Page selections will be
reviewed with the Client to ensure appropriateness. Each page will be continuously monitored from more than one
location outside of MOD's network on a round-robin basis at least one time per minute. A page fails a monitoring test if
two monitoring locations fail to access a page in two successive tries from each monitoring location.  
3.2, Uptime Calculation: Uptime will be.calculated at the end of each month based on data extracted from MOD's external
monitoring provider. In the event-of at least two successive failures, the page will be considered to be unavailable from
the time of the first failure.vntil the first subsequent success. All such intervals will be reviewed and validated by MOD
Uptime will then be calculated as the sum of all periods during which the API was available during the calendar month,
divided by the total time.in’the month. One percentage will be calculated for the month period.  
3.3. Exclusions: Any failute due to an outage of a third party vendor to MOD will be excluded from the Uptime Calculation
Incidents caused-by third party vendors will otherwise be classified and handled the same as issues caused by MOD.  
3.4. Service Credits: If, in any calendar month during the Term, Uptime falls below the Uptime Requirement, then without
limiting any other right or remedy to which Client may be entitled as a result of such Uptime, whether under this
Agreement, at law or in equity, MOD will grant Client a credit for that month based on the table set forth below
(‘Service Credits”), calculated as follows: the percentage set forth in the table below multiplied by the Service Fees  
due to for the same period.

specific targets (the “Response Time Requirement”). For purposes of this Schedule, Response Time means the amount of
time it takes to deliver the first byte of the requested data to the end user, measured from the time the applicable call is

Monitoring Approach: Each request will be continuously monitored from more than one location outside of MOD's
network on a round-robin basis at least one time per minute. Response time will be recorded by MOD's external
monitoring provider. Response times will not be considered for failures; failures are addressed via the Uptime
Requirement.  
Response Time Calculation: Uptime will be calculated at the end of each month based on data extracted from MOD's
external monitoring provider. All successful requests that completed in less than the associated target time-will be
tallied. The percentage of requests that satisfy the Response Time Requirement shall be the number that completed in
less than the associated target time divided by the total number of requests that completed successfully. One
percentage will be calculated for each request during the month. As noted above, unsuccessful fequests are not
included in this calculation because they are addressed through the Uptime Requirement and the-associated Service
Credits.  
Exclusions: Any Response Time impact due to slowness of a third party vendor to MOD-will be excluded from the
Response Time Calculation.  
Service Credits: If, in any calendar month during the Term, Response Timefalls below the Response Time
Requirement, then without limiting any other right or remedy to which Client.may be entitled as a result of such
