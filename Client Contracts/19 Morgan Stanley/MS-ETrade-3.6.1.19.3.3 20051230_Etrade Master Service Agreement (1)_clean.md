15.2 Availability - “Availability” means the amount of time in a calendar month during which Client may access
and has use of the Customized Solution. “Available Hours” means albtimes of day and night, 7 days a week, 365
days a year, excluding Scheduled Outages.  
15.3 Uptime - “Uptime” shall be calculated as a percentage\by taking the total number of minutes within the
Available Hours for the month, minus the total number_éf.minutes of Monitored Product Failure divided by the
total number of minutes within the Available Hours for the month. For example, in a thirty day month, there are
43,200 minutes, assuming all the minutes in the month are counted as Available Hours. During this month, 30
minutes of Monitored Product Failures would cofstitute a 0.07% loss of Uptime (30/43,200 = 0.07%). Uptime in a
month with 30 minutes of Monitored Product Failure would be 99.93% uptime which is our benchmark service
level.  
15.4 Exclusions - WSOD is responsible for resolving all System (firewall, router, global load balancer, network,  
session management / authentication and web scrvcr response) and Application (quotes, charts, news, report  
retrieval, screening and data retrieval) related problems. Degraded Performance (either site slowness or page
unavailability) due to Client's infrastructure, or telecommunications failure beyond WSOD’s control will not affect
service level performance standards for purposes of the Service Level calculations.  
a) Scheduled Outage’-)A Scheduled Outage shall be defined as the period once each calendar month not to
exceed four consécutive hours in length during which the System shall be inaccessible. Scheduled Outages
will occur of)Saturday of the first full weekend of the month between 12:01 am and 4:00 am eastern time.
WSOD may require additional time; any additional time taken is not considered a Scheduled Outage.
Scheduled Outages are excluded from system availability calculations.  
b) The(24 x 7 site monitoring and total minutes of Monitored Product Failure will exclude any non-scheduled
atid’ scheduled outages of the Third Party Monitoring Provider (Dot Com Monitor or Gomez) in which the
provider is unable to run the web tests.  
c) A Monitored Product Failure will exclude any failure due to any third party telecommunications provider.  
d) Site monitors that fail due to unavailability of a third party provider of the Client will not be included in the
service level performance calculations.

Site Performance — Performance measurements will be based on HTML download times which do not include
items typically cached by the user’s browser (Such as javascript, CSS and static images. Measurements will be
made using a third party provider (Dot Com Monitor) from outside the firewall at various regional monitoring

benchmarks are;
