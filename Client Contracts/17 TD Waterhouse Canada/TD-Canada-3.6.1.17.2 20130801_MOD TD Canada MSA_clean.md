Toronto-Dominion Bank (“TD”) and Markit On Demand, Inc. (“MOD”) made as of the Effective Date of the  
Agreement and may not be executed as a stand-alone document.  
This SLA:  
e Establishes the Service Levels with which MOD is required to comply in providing the Services to TD;  
e Establishes the remedies available to TD and the escalation procedures that the parties will follow in the event
that MOD fails to meet applicable Service Levels;  
e Describes the responsibilities of each party with regard to Service Levels.  
1 Response Time  
MOD will be available to receive requests for maintenance and support services via the Network Operations Center

or 303.583.4308,  
Problems with the Customized Solution will be classified according to the impact that they have on Client.

site or significant functionality within the site is non-functional or inaccessible, inoperable or interrupted such that
end users cannot reasonably continue to use the site. Examp)es include: Client’s entire site is unavailable; Client’s
key services (such as real time quotes or charting functionality) are unavailable; and Client’s APIs are unavailable.  
Level Two — Major Impact: A problem that has a material impact on Client’s business operations, such as if certain

```  
```col-md
MOD is not responsible for any problem that MOD identifies as being due to a data or content provider.  
Site Availability  
2.1 Definitions  
“Availability” means the amount of time in a calendar month during whichthe MOD Services are
available. “Available Hours” means all times of day and night, 24 hour a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year,
excluding any Scheduled Maintenance Period.  
“Uptime Percentage” shall be calculated by taking the total number of minutes within the Available Hours in a
given calendar month, subtracting the total number of minutes during which the MOD Services are not available,
and dividing by the total number of minutes within the Available Hours. For example, in a thirty daymonth, there
are 43,200 minutes, assuming no Scheduled Maintenance Period. If during this month, the MOD Services are
unavailable for a total of 432 minutes, the Uptime Percentage for that calendar month would be 99% (43,200432/43,200).  
The following shall be excluded for purposes of Uptime Percentage calculations:  
a) Any outage that occurs during a Scheduled Maintenance Period. MOD may be required to perform systemwide maintenance, during which period the Customized Solution may be\inaccessible (each such period, a
“Scheduled Maintenance Period”). Any such Scheduled MaintenancePeriod shall occur no more often than
once per month, on a designated Sunday between midnight and 4 a.niZastern Time. MOD will provide Client
with at least five (5) business days’ notice via email of any Scheduled Maintenance Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if reasonably necessary, MOD pay provide a shortey‘notice of Scheduled Maintenance.  
b) Any failure due to any outage of a third party telecommunications provider, third party monitoring provider,
third party data provider or any other type of third party vendor contracted by Client.  
c)} Any failure of any third party vendor’s hardware or software that is not caused by MOD.  
2.2, Monitoring  
For purposes of determining the Uptime Percentage, MOD and Client will mutually agree on a subset of pages to
monitor. Each page will be monitored from more than one location outside of MOD’s network on a round-robin
basis at least once every five minutes. A\page fails a monitoring test if two monitoring locations fail to access a page
in two successive tries from each monitoring location.

Quote Metering Process  
WALL STREET ON DEMAND  
REAL-TIME EXCHANGE REPORTING PROCESS August 3, 2009  
‘The following dacument detalls the process that WSOD employs to send TDW daily files of quote
logs. Included In the process are control measures to ensure system operation, proper
notification and data integrity. These processes are explained below.  
DVERV]  
WSO's quoteserver system serves real time and delayed quotes acrossall of \WSOD's cllents.
All real time quote requests {across cllents) are logged by quoteserver and stored In flles across
muttiple servers,  
All of WSOD's clients, with the exceptlon of TD Waterhouse Canada utlllze our Usage Reporting
department ta recelve monthly reports of real time quotes logged. TO Waterhouse Canada
utilizes a highly custom process created specifically far sending dally Real Time quote logs ta
TDW. This custom process (s separate from any other process and Is utflized solely by TD
Waterhouse Canada.  
‘WSOD has several automated tasks, within our feed management engineering group, that run
during the day to process TOW’s.reai tline quotes. The first two are detailed below as an
Intsaday hourly task and a dally task:  
* Intraday Task Details:
© This task rons frequently throughout the day, picking up the hourly Ing files
fronrthe quoteservers,  
~ Control Measures: Through the use of Strong Exclustons, we evaluate
the actual content of the file and not Just the file name to ansure that
we keep track of files that have been processed and thus,
guaranteelng that we never process the same log file more than ance.  
© The task parses these log flles and uses several filters to pull out TOWCA
spaclfic quotes that are fee llable, non test quates, non test accounts, not fram
an Internal (W50D) IP address, and several other filters.  
© Once the parsing and filtering Is complete, these records are dropped Into a
staging lacation for the dally task to pick up. These files have timestamps In
thelr file names so that when the daily task runs, it can alsa malntaln an
internal Ilst of files it has already processed,  
«Control Measures: Through use of tlmestamps In the file names and
keeping track of the flle names, ve guarantee staging files will not be
processed more than once.  
* Dally Task Details:
© This task runs at 07:00 AM EST on a dally basts. It pulls all of the files from the
staging location (as resulting fram the Intraday task) that it has not yet
processed,  
= Controt Measure i: The dally task processes trailing day data only.
