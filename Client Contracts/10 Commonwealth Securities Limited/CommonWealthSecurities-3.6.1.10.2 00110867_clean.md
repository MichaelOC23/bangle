N/A for this Order

N/A for this Order  
5.5. Service Levels and Service Credits  
5.5.1 Uptime Requirement: Supplier will ensure that the Customized
Solution will be available at least 99.9% of the time as measured over
each calendar month during the Term (“Uptime Requirement’).  
5.5.2 Monitoring Approach: Supplier will choose one or more pages of the
Customized Solution to monitor in order to determine Uptime. Page
selections will be reviewed with the Bank to ensure appropriateness.
Each page will be monitored continuously from more than one location
outside of Supplier's network on a round-robin basis at least once per
minute. A page fails a monitoring test if two monitoring locations fail to
access a page in two successive tries from each monitoring location.  
5.5.3 Uptime Calculation: Uptime will be calculated at the end of each month
based on data provided by Supplier's external monitoring provider. A
page will be considered to be unavailable from the time of the first
failure until the first subsequent success. All such intervals will be
reviewed and validated by Supplier. Uptime will then be calculated as
the sum of all periods during which the page was available during the
calendar month, divided by the total time in the month. One percentage
will be calculated per month. Scheduled Maintenance as described in
Section 5.8 below shall not be included for purposes of calculating
Uptime.

Announcements API <2 seconds Supplier's monitoring provider  
Supplier's Monitoring Approach: Each request will be continuously monitored
from more than one location outside of Supplier's network on a round-robin
basis at least once per minute. Response time will be recorded by Supplier's
external monitoring provider (e.g. DOTCOM). Response times will, mot be

will be monitored by independent third-party monitoring provider, such as
Keynote, from more than one location outside of Supplier's-network on a roundrobin basis at least once every five minutes. A page fails“a monitoring test if
two monitoring locations fail to access a page in two successive tries from each
monitoring location. Bank shall be responsible for-contracting with the thirdparty monitoring provider (e.g. Keynote) te.monitor the pages and shall
facilitate the delivery of the raw data to Supplier for reporting purposes. In the
event that there is any disagreement between Supplier and the Bank regarding
the results of the monitoring, the Bank shall require the third-party monitoring
provider to provide Supplier with access to all relevant data.  
Response Time Calculation:;Response Time will be calculated at the end of
each month based on data.provided by Supplier’s external monitoring provider.
The percentage of requests that satisfy the Response Time Requirement shall
be the number that Completed in less than the associated target time divided
by the total number of requests that completed successfully. One percentage
will be calculated)for each request during the month.  
Exclusions: “Any impact due to a Third Party will be excluded from the
Response’ Time Requirement calculation. Compliance with the Response Time
Requirement shall not be required during any Scheduled Maintenance period
as described in Section 5.8 below.
