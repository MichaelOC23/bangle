17 GST and Taxes  
17.1 GST
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e)  
A capitalised term or expression used in this clause 17.1, which has a defined
meaning in the GST Law, has the same meaning as in the GST Law unless
the context otherwise indicates.  
Any fees payable upon termination or suspension of this Agreement and any
other amounts referred to in this Agreement, including the Fees, exclude GST,
unless otherwise agreed between the parties.  
If GST is or becomes payable on a Supply made under or in connection with
this Agreement, an additional amount (an Additional Amount) is payable by
the party providing consideration for the Supply (the Recipient) equal to the
amount of GST payable on that Supply as calculated by the party-making the
Supply (in this clause 17.1 only, the Supplier) in accordance with the GST
Law.  
The Additional Amount payable under paragraph (c)is'\payable at the same
time and in the same manner as the Consideration ‘for the Supply, and the
Supplier must provide the Recipient with a Tax Invoice immediately after the
time of payment of the Additional Amount ifyaTax Invoice has not already
been provided under this Agreement.  
If for any reason (including the occurrence of an Adjustment Event) the
amount of GST payable on a Supply (taking into account any Decreasing or
Increasing Adjustments in relation\to’the Supply) varies from the Additional
Amount payable by the Recipient\under paragraph (c):  
(i) the Supplier must-provide a refund or credit to the Recipient, or the
Recipient must paya further amount to the Supplier, as appropriate;  
(ii) the refund, ‘credit or further amount (as the case may be) will be
calculated by-the Supplier in accordance with the GST Law; and  
(iii) the Supplier must notify the Recipient of the refund, credit or further
amount within 10 Business Days after becoming aware of the variation
tothe amount of GST payable. If there is an Adjustment Event in
relation to the Supply, the requirement for the Supplier to notify the
Recipient will be satisfied by the Supplier issuing to the Recipient an
Adjustment Note within 10 Business Days after becoming aware of the
occurrence of the Adjustment Event.  
If either party is entitled under this Agreement to be paid, reimbursed or
indemnified by the other party for a loss, cost or expense, the payment,
reimbursement or indemnity payment will be reduced by an amount equal to
any input tax credit which may be claimed by the party entitled to be paid,
reimbursed or indemnified (or by its representative member if that party is in a
GST group) in respect of that loss, cost or expense.  
To the extent that the amount referred to in paragraph (c) to be reimbursed or
indemnified by a party represents consideration for a taxable supply by the
recipient of the payment, the paying party must pay the recipient an additional
amount equal to the portion of the amount which is consideration for a taxable
supply multiplied by the GST rate prevailing at the time the relevant taxable
