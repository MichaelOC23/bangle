Exhibit C
Service Level Agreement  
1. Overview  
The general purpose of this document is to establish an agreement as to the service levels required for the ongoing
support of the Project or services provided to Fidelity by Wall Street on Demand. This Service Level Agreement
(“SLA”) terminates upon the termination of the Agreement.  
In order to effectively manage our vendors, Fidelity has put in place vendor specific SLAs to measure each\ vendor’s
overall service, web site availability and web site performance. The typical SLA has multiple sections including
escalation matrices, contact lists, problem classification definitions, change management procedures, availability
criteria and performance criteria. All of the items mentioned above are important to the relationship between
Fidelity and the third party vendor (“TPV”). This document focuses on the calculations used (a-determine if Wall
Street On Demand is or is not in compliance with the SLA .  
2. Testing Methodology  
Fidelity Investments, specifically the Internet Operations Center (IOC) will use Sitescope and/or Topaz to run all
tests from multiple domestic locations. Fidelity reserves the right to change monitoring tools at its sole discretion.
Notification of a monitoring tool change will be communicated to all involved parties with at least thirty (30) days
prior notice.  
Frequency Components. Evaluated Data Returned  
Benchmark Test 12 times per hour Full HTML/No images DNS, Connect, Redirect, 1*
byte, content  
Transactional Test 12 times per hour Full HTML/No images/ per page | DNS, Connect, Redirect, 1*
data byte, content  
Transactional Test 4 times per hour Fulf HTML/No images/ per page | DNS, Connect, Redirect, 1*
data byte, content  
Full Page Download | | time per hour Full HTML/Images DNS, Connect, Redirect, 1*
byte, content  
All tests will be targeted at the “top level” load balancing URL. URLs will be selected based on the criticality of the
functionality to http://fidelity.com and will be designed to exercise all components of Wall Street on Demand’s
infrastructure. SLA compliance will be evaluated based on the availability of the service to the customer. It is not
necessary that all servers\in Wall Street On Demand’s infrastructure function 100% of the time. It is necessary for
the service to be available to the customer.  
The data collected-from all tests will be evaluated in three different ways: availability, minimum acceptable response
time and average response time (calculations are detailed below). SLA compliance data will be available to Wall
Street On Demand via email reports or a Fidelity Investments hosted web site. On a monthly basis, all tests must
pass for-Wall Street On Demand to be considered in compliance. Wall Street On Demand does not need to pass
every test for every window. A failure to pass any of the three tests on a monthly basis will constitute noncompliance for the month.  
Topaz will conduct tests from their multiple domestic locations at five-minute or fifteen-minute intervals. The
intervals will be calculated by each individual testing agent, allowing a 300 or 900 second “sleep cycle” from the
completion of the first test iteration until the start of the next test iteration. Therefore, due to variances in the
response times at each location we cannot guarantee there will be a consistent number of tests in each window. Test
results will be bucketed for calculation purposes based on the completion time of each test.

```  
```col-md
Simple content tests (Benchmark Test) will run from up to 3+ locations at five minute intervals. Transactional Tests
will run from up to 2 locations at five minute or fifteen minute intervals. A quorum of 40% of the testing locations is
necessary for a Benchmark test five-minute interval to be considered valid. A quorum of 50% of the testing
locations is necessary for a Transactional test fifteen-minute interval to be considered valid. If a five-minute or
fifteen-minute interval is invalid due to failure to meet the quorum criteria then that window will be ignored for SLA
calculation purposes.  
Certain time frames, testing locations or URLs may be exempt from calculation for a variety of reasons: testing
location unavailable, tech window, change window, etc. Exempt items will be excluded from the SLA compliance
calculations.  
Fidelity, through Topaz, executes tests for many different TPVs and clients from the same locations. These test
results give Fidelity the ability to determine if a testing location is functioning properly. In order to.automatically
identify and exempt a testing location (node) the following data cleansing will be performed.  
At least 80% of a node’s scheduled tests must execute for the node to be considered valid for the stated window.
At least 75% of a node’s tests must complete successfully for the node to be considered valid for the stated  
window.
© The average response time of all tests executing at a given node for a given window must be within 100% of the
30 day moving average of all tests from that node for the node to be considered valid for the stated window.  
3. Service Level Requirements  
3.1 Availability  
3.1.1 Testing  
This test is designed to verify the reliability and availability of the service provided by Wall Street On Demand.  
Availability and data quality is considered in this test.OQyefall response time is not considered during this test, unless
the availability threshold is exceeded. This test uses either the Benchmark or Transactional Test.  
Definition [ Threshold |
Threshold Response Time 60 seconds
Periodic Availability Threshold 75.00%  
| Monthly Availability Threshold | Determine After Load testing Completed  
The Availability Test will be calculated as follows for the Benchmark Test examples (Calculation examples are
presented in Attachment D):  
1. The response.time for each test in a five-minute window will be recorded.  
2. The responsestimes for each test within a five-minute window will then be evaluated versus the Threshold
Response Time to determine which tests passed or failed. (If Test Response Time is less than Threshold
Response Time then the test passes, if not it fails)  
3. Basedson the pass/fail status of each test in a given window a Periodic Pass Percentage will be calculated.
(Number of Tests Passed / Number of Tests in Window = Periodic Pass Percentage)  
4.  
<The Periodic Pass Percentage will then be compared to the Periodic Availability Threshold to determine if
the window is a Pass or a Fail. (If Periodic Pass Percentage is greater than Periodic Availability Threshold
then the window passes, if not it fails)  
5. A Monthly Pass Percentage will be calculated based on the pass/fail status of all the windows in a given
month. (Monthly Pass Percentage = Number of Window passes / Number of Windows for the Month)  
6. The Monthly Pass Percentage will then be compared to the Monthly Availability Threshold to determine if
Wall Street On Demand passes or fails the test for the month. (If Monthly Pass Percentage is greater than or
equal to the Monthly Availability Threshold then the month passes, if not it fails)

Specific items to be tested, the location from which the tests will be run, and the frequency of the tests are presented
in Attachment A. Wall Street on Demand agrees that Attachment A can be amended during the term of this
Agreement with approval of both parties and that all content/services/pages provided by Wall Street on Demand are
subject to the terms of this SLA, even though they may not be included in the performance monitoring.  
3.2 Average Response Time  
3.2.1 Testing  
This test is designed to ensure the service provided by Wall Street On Demand is, on average, delivered to the
customer in a timely manner. While we realize it is unreasonable to expect the customer will receive all responses-in  
a timely manner, it is important to verify that, on average, responses are received in a timely manner. \ Average
response time, availability and data quality are considered in this test.  
Definition Default Threshold i
Monthly Average Response Time Threshold Determine After Load testing Completed |  
The Average Response Time Test will be calculated as follows for a simple content test using the Benchmark Test
(Calculation examples are presented in Attachment E):  
1. The response time for each test in a five-minute window will be recorded.  
2. The response times for each test within a five-minute window will\then be averaged to calculate the
Periodic Average Response Time. This process will be repeated¢forsevery given window throughout the
month.  
3. The Periodic Average Response Times will be averaged together to calculate the Monthly Average Time
Response Time.  
4. The Monthly Average Time will then be compared to the Monthly Average Response Time Threshold to
determine if the month is a Pass or Fail . (If the Monthly Average Response Time is less than or equal to
the Monthly Average Response Time Threshold then the month passes, if not it fails)  
3.3 Minimal Acceptable Response Time
3.3.1 Testing  
This test is designed to ensure the vast majority of the service provided by Wall Street On Demand is delivered to
the customer in a timely manner. While we realize it is unreasonable to expect that the customer will receive all
responses in a timely manner, it isimportant to verify that the vast majority of responses are received in a timely
manner. Response time, availability and data quality are considered in this test. Average response time is not
considered during this test.This test uses either the Benchmark or Transactional Test.  
Definition | Default Threshold
Threshold Responsé Time [10 seconds  
Periodic Availabitity Threshold 75.00% |
Monthly Availability Threshold 97.00%  
The Minimum Acceptable Response Time Test will be calculated as follows for the Benchmark Test (Calculation
exaniples are presented in Attachment F):  
1. The response time for each test in a five-minute window will be recorded.  
2. The response times for each test within a five-minute window will then be evaluated versus the Threshold
Response Time to determine which tests passed or failed. If the test fails because of the web server
application and recycling the servers clears the issue, the five-minute test will be exempt from the overall
calculation. If Test Response Time is less than Threshold Response Time then the test passes, if not it fails.

3. Based on the pass/fail status of each test in a given window a Periodic Pass Percentage will be calculated.
(Number of Tests Passed / Number of Tests in a Window = Periodic Pass Percentage)  
4. The Periodic Pass Percentage will then be compared to the Periodic Availability Threshold to determine if
the window is a Pass or a Fail. (If the Periodic Pass Percentage is greater than the Periodic Availability
Threshold then the window passes, if not it fails)  
5. A Monthly Pass Percentage will be calculated based on the pass/fail status of all the windows in a given
month. (Monthly Pass Percentage = Number of Window passes / Number of Windows in the Month)  
6. The Monthly Pass Percentage will then be compared to the Monthly Availability Threshold to determine if
Wall Street On Demand passes or fails the test for the month. (If Monthly Pass Percentage is greater than
or equal to the Monthly Availability Threshold then the month passes, if not it fails)  
Minimal Acceptable Response Time test is calculated using the response times measured from first(byte to
content download. The items to be tested, the location from which the tests will be run, and the frequency of
the tests are presented in Attachment A. Wall Street on Demand agrees that Attachment A can be‘amended
during the term of this Agreement with approval of both parties and that all content/services/pages provided by
Wall Street on Demand are subject to the terms of this SLA, even though they may not-be included in the
performance monitoring.  
3.4. Liquidated Damages  
The damages to Fidelity in the event that Wall Street On Demand fails to pass the-Availability, Average Response
Time or Minimal Acceptable Response Time tests will have a substantial negative impact to Fidelity’s customer
base. Therefore, the parties agree that the Fidelity total fees payable¢to\Wall Street On Demand under this
Agreement shall be reduced by 25% for any month in which Wali Street(On Demand fails to uphold any of the terms
of this Service Level Agreement herein as liquidated damages and not(as.a- penalty.  
The foregoing represents the sole remedy available to Fidelity for'service disruptions. The Service Level Standards
do not include network unavailability resulting from (a) schcdiled network or server maintenance, (b) circuits

9 Attachment D: Availability Test Examples  
91 Example 1 Availability Test Five-Minute Window
Number of Testing Nodes = 30  
(Step 1) Sample response times (in seconds) from 30 locations:  
2 3 I 5 60 2 2 2 3 1  
5 25 1 2 2 3 2 42 3 6
60 35 2 2 I 1 1 3 5 4
(Step 2) Sample Threshold Response Time Comparison (Based on Step I above):  
Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass
Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass
Fail Pass | Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass  
(Step 3) Calculate Periodic Pass Percentage (Based on Step 2 above):
Number of Tests Passed / Number of Tests in Window = Periodic Pass Percentage
28/30 = 93.33%  
(Step 4) Determine if Window passes or fails (Based on Step 3 above):  
If Periodic Pass Percentage is greater than Periodic Availability Threshold then the window passes, if not it fails.
Periodic Pass Percentage = 93.33%  
Periodic Availability Threshold = 75.00%  
93.33% > 75.00%  
Window PASSES  
(Step 5) Calculate Monthly Pass Percentage (Based on Step 4 above):
Number of five-minute windows in 30 day month = 8640 (Assumes no exemptions)
12 tests/hour x 24 hours/day x 30 days/month = 8640
12 x 24 x 30 = 8640
Number of five-minute window failures: Assume 13
Number of five-minute window passes
Number of monthly five-minute windows — Number of five-minute window failures
8640 - 13 = 8627
Monthly Pass Percentage = Number of Window passes / Number of Windows for the Month
Monthly Pass Percentage = 8627 / 8640
Monthly Pass Percentage = 99.85%.  
(Step 6) Determine if Month passes or fails (Based on Step 5 above):  
If Monthly Pass Percentagéis greater than or equal to the Monthly Availability Threshold then the month passes, if
not it fails  
Monthly Pass Percentage = 99.85%  
Monthly Availability Threshold = 97.00%  
99.85% = 97.00%  
Month PASSES.  
The availability test calculation above can also be performed using the Transactional Test. In this case, substitute
fifteén>minute for five-minute in steps 1 and 2 and replace Example J with Example 2.

Attachment G: Security Requirements
12.1 Physical Security  
Physical access to the Wall Street on Demand Internet Data Center (“IDC”) will be restricted to authorized
personnel only. Access to the Area where Fidelity Customer data is processed will be restricted to those personnel
specifically authorized in writing by Fidelity. Access to the IDC buildings is limited and non-employees are
escorted by Wall Street on Demand personnel. Access to these areas is to be logged for audit purposes. Equipment
which contains Fidelity information will be physically secured within the computer room. The premises are
monitored 24 hours per day and monitoring procedures of the premises will immediately inform Wall Street on
Demand of unauthorized access into the facilities.  
12.2 System Security  
All remote access capabilities (FTP, telnet, http, gopher, shell, console and any others methods) toulhe system root or
areas behind the firewall require authentication procedures. Authentication will be ‘implemented using
username/password verification. Wall Street on Demand will implement a policy that passwords will be selected
such that system passwords are complex enough in length to reduce “dictionary attacks” (o-crack these passwords.
All system access except that absolutely necessary to offer and administer the Service (will be configured by Wall
Street on Demand to prevent an intruder from gaining access to the system. Aliifequests denied access cannot
receive any information about the Wall Street on Demand hardware/software configuration.  
12.3 Application Security  
Access between secured and unsecured portions of the system will not be performed by CGI scripts. No third party
shall have access to Fidelity or its customer’s information or web/server access log files containing URLs used
exclusively by Fidelity and its customers that is physically stored on the same server. All user input and data,
including URL name-value arguments, will be checked for its appropriateness based on its format, size and validity.
All outside data requests (i-e. http/https requests) are allowed in a specified, controlled format which is processed by
Wall Street on Demand according to prescribed procedures and the request results are then sent back to the outside
party. The main Wall Street on Demand servers dp snot have the ability to remotely execute arbitrary outside
requests, except for remote management performed over an encrypted, authenticated VPN.  
12.4 Network Security  
The Wall Street on Demand router contains a packet filter, which has been configured to disallow access to all
protocols. All routers provided to Wall Street on Demand by third parties are to be segmented to provide Wall Street
on Demand’s network traffic in isolation of other network traffic; the Wall Street on Demand’s segment contains a
packet filter which has been configured to disallow access to all protocols. When a protocol (such as http and https)
is allowed to call into the. Wail Street on Demand system, that protocol must a) be explicitly exceptioned into the
packet filters or b) use Specialized hardware which is built to specifically allow only certain protocol calls into the
Wall Street on Demarid system. No dial-up login is possible. Server systems contain no network accounts.
Monitoring procedures of the firewall will immediately inform Wall Street on Demand of any unauthorized access
or otherwise suspicious attempts to access secured portions of the system across the network.  
12.5 General  
Fidelity or designees may inspect Wall Street on Demand’s facilities at any reasonable time, and upon reasonable
ptior notice, to verify and audit Wall Street on Demand’s security procedures.  
Wall Street on Demand shall report any security breaches or compromises to Fidelity within one business day
following the day on which Wall Street on Demand learns of the occurrence.  
Any security breaches or compromises shall be terminated immediately through the best efforts of Wall Street on
Demand

as deemed necessary by Wall Street on Demand to stop the compromise.  
Wall Street on Demand shall present Fidelity with documentation of the cause, remedial steps, and future plans to
prevent a recurrence within five (5) business days following the day on which Wall Street on Demand learns of the
occurrence of the security breach or compromise. If these measures are not deemed acceptable, based on Fidelity’s
reasonable judgement, Wall Street on Demand shall, upon receipt of written request from Fidelity, enter into good
faith negotiations to address the differences within five (S) business days.  
Fidelity shall be notified of any proposed modifications to these Security Measures at least ten (10) business days
prior to implementation and Fidelity has the right, based on its reasonable judgement, to veto or deny any proposed
modifications in the event that such modifications (i) would lessen the then-current level of security, or (ii) would be
below industry standards.

1. Overview  
Every morning, WSOD will generate the HTML and text content as normal. Instead of emailing the content
anywhere, this newly generated content will get posted to a web server at WSOD. The following rules must apply to
these new pages:  
1. The specific content for each templated report (4 reports / 2 versions each for a total of 8 reports) will live
in the same place every time it is generated, same file name, same URL etc.  
2. New templates will be provided that will remove the need to attach PDFs to the emails and meet our,
internal requirements for personalization.  
Every morning, Fidelity will pick up this newly generated content (via HTTP-GET) and marry it to thévemail list
and send it out to the Fidelity customer base.  
2. Templates  
Fidelity will supply new templates to WSOD that remove the need to have PDFs as attachments in the emails. To
that end, Fidelity will need URLs for any PDFs that were previously attached to emails sent to Fidelity customers
(supplied by WSOD). URLs for unsubscribe and the alert activation will no longer be provided by WSOD, they will
come from FeB to FAA to incorporate into the new templates. Each report will have it’s own directory on the
WSOD server. See appendix for approved templates.  
3. eFS Processing Requirements  
3.1 Produce eMAIL Content
Fidelity will supply new templates to WSGD that remove the need to have PDFs as
attachments in the emails. To that end,Fidelity will need URLs for any PDFs that were
previously attached to emails sent to Fidelity customers (supplied by WSOD). URLs for

from FeB to FAA to incorporateinto the new templates. Each report will have it’s own
directory on the WSOD server. See appendix for approved templates, Links will be:
