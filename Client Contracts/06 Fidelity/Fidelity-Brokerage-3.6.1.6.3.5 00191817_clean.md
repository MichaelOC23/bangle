Parties agreed to: Richard Lyons  
ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE  
Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (Fidelity, we or us) has established a relationship with
DocuSign, an unaffiliated third party provider of e-signature technology, to enable electronic
signature of contracts and associated documents by Fidelity and third party vendors (Vendor or
you). From time to time, Fidelity may also use DocuSign to provide you with certain written
documents or disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions related to your use of
the, DocuSign electronic signing system (DocuSign). Please read the information below carefully
and-thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and
agree-to these terms and conditions, please confirm your agreement by clicking the 'I agree'
button at the bottom of this document.  
Getting paper copies  
At any time, yousmay request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available
electronically to youw-by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send
to you through the DocuSign system during and immediately after signing session and, if you
elect to create a DocuSign signer account, you may access them for a limited period of time
(usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to
send you paper copies of any/such documents, you may do so at any time for no fee. You may
request delivery of such paper Copies from us by following the procedure described below.
Withdrawing your consent  
If you decide to receive documents afid disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time
change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required documents and
disclosures only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future
documents and disclosure in paper format and\withdraw your consent to receive documents and
disclosures electronically is described below.  
Consequences of changing your mind  
If you elect to receive documents and disclosures only in paper format, it may slow the speed at
which we can complete certain steps in transactions with yow because we will need first to send
the required documents or disclosures to you in paper format, and then wait until we receive
back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such papet-documents or disclosures. To
indicate to us that you are changing your mind, you must withdraw your consent using the
DocuSign 'Withdraw Consent’ form on the signing page of a DocuSign’énvelope instead of
signing it. This will indicate to us that you have withdrawn your consent to‘receive required
documents and disclosures electronically from us and you will no longer beable to use the
DocuSign system to receive required documents from us or to sign documents from us
electronically.  
Documents and disclosures will be sent to you electronically  
Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, or unless
otherwise agreed, we will provide disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other
documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our
relationship with you electronically through the DocuSign system. To reduce the chance of you
inadvertently not receiving any documents or disclosures, we will use the same address that you
have given us when sending any documents and disclosures to you electronically. Thus, you can
receive all the documents and disclosures electronically or in paper format through the paper
mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described
below. Please also see the paragraph immediately above that describes the consequences of your
