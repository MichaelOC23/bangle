paper notices or disclosures. To indicate to us that you are changing your mind, you must

electronically to you through your DocuSign user account all required notices, disclosures,

madesavailable to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of
you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required

the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as
