STATEMENT OF WORK #10:
Mutual Fund Screener — Hypothetical Growth of 10K
Chart  
This Statement of Work (“SOW”) is entered into between Markit On
Demand, Inc. (“S&P”) and Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC
(“Customer”) pursuant to, and incorporating by reference all terms
and conditions of the Master Agreement between Markit On
Demand, Inc. and Customer dated January 1, 2003 (the
“Agreement”). References to “MOD” /“Markit” / “IHS Markit” and
“Subscriber’/“Client” (as the case may be in the Agreement) shall
be read, for the purpose of this SOW, to mean “S&P” and
“Customer” as defined herein.  
This SOW constitutes a separate agreement between S&P and
Customer for the services described herein. The parties agree that
this SOW and the services provided hereunder are subject to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement, incorporated into this SOW
by reference. In case of inconsistency between the terms of the
Agreement and the terms of this SOW, the terms of this SOW shall
prevail. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this SOW shall
have the meanings given to such terms in the Agreement.  
This SOW commences on October 31, 2023 (“Effective Date’).  
Project Description
14 Customized Solution  
S&P will replace the current Hypothetical Growth of 10K chart with
Fidelity’s current charting solution S&P’s ChartlQ (the “Customized
Solution”) to remedy a vulnerability identified by Customer’s cyber
security team.  
The Customized Solution will include the features listed below:  
. Replace Fidelity’s current chart implementation with
S&P’s ChartlQ solution.  
e Support similar already existing chart anid current
functionality for the Hypothetical Growth-of 10K chart:  
o Allow comparison of up tosfive (5) mutual funds
and four (4) indices to be added to the chart
simultaneously.  
o Legend
o Dynamic hover over data
o Timeframes and frequencies  
o Allow zooming to the chart (in/out)  
1.2 Assumptions  
e S&P jhas not been aware of the specifics of the security
Vulnerability Customer has observed. S&P cannot
guarantee that a ChartlQ solution will solve the underlying
issue.  
e S&P will continue to use Customer's API for data to power
the chart. The data set retrieval from Fidelity through
current API integration will remain as is and may require
some manipulation and transformation.  
e Existing authentication will be reused — the chart does not
require authentication as it is powered by the data set
passed in the configuration.
