6.3 Defense of Claim. A party (“Indemnitee”) shall provide timely notice of any
claim for which it may seek indemnification under this Section 6 and shall

either party's failure to provide such notice will not excuse the indemnifying party
from its indemnification obligations and duties to defend, except to the extent that
the indemnifying party's ability to defend or settle the relevant Claim is actually
prejudiced by such failure). The Indemnitor shall have the right to control the
defense of any such claim, provided that the Indemnitee may participate in the
proceedings at its own expense. The Indemnitor shall not enter into any
settlement or compromise of any such claim, or make any attribution of fault of

delayed.  
6.4 Exemption from Indemnity. The Indemnitor shall not be obliged to
indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to any loss to the extent such loss arises
from the fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Indemnitee or an Affiliate thereof. The, indemnity in Section
6.2(a) shall not apply (and Markit shall have no liability’to-Subscriber Indemnitees
thereunder) to the extent that the infringement referred*to in Section 6.2(a) results
from any unauthorised use or distribution by Subscriber of the Services (or any
data forming part of the Services) or any alteration or modification of the Services
