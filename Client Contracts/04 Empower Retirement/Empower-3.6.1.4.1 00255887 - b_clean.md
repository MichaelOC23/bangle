In order to electronically sign the Document Package, you will need to access a unique
link sent to your email address that you provided to us. After signing the Document
Package, we will receive a court-admissible “Certificate of Completion.” This
“Certificate of Completion” contains a digital audit trail of the transaction, including the
signer names, authentication history, digital signatures, email addresses, signer IP
addresses, chain of custody (i.e., sent, viewed, signed, etc.), trusted timestamps,
geolocation capture of the signer (if provided), and completion status. By accepting this

emailed to you, is the legal equivalent of actual physical delivery, such as delivery by the
United States Postal Service or hand-delivery, whether or not you actually see or view the
Document Package. For purposes of this agreement, unless we receive actual notice of a
delivery failure, we shall be deemed to have’conclusively delivered the Document
Package to you when we attach and send ihe document(s) to the email address that you
provided to us.
