Exhibit 1  
IMDM REPORTING PLATFORM  
1.1 Markit On Demand, Inc. (MOD) Customized Solution  
MOD (working collaboratively with Prudential Retirement) designed and built a workflow-based IMDM reporting solution that served
Prudential Retirement's internal and external reporting needs. MOD developed the overall report generation tool and the key capabilities
within it, including but not limited to report templates, data calculation engine and an administrative interface to manage content such
as footnotes, disclosures, glossary of terms and DDA commentary. All data within the IMDM reporting solution was (with the exception
of Yield curve information) provided by Prudential Retirement. The data provided by Prudential Retirement was sourced primarily
through Prudential Retirement 's implementation of MOD EDM, and other sources as needed.  
The report preview tool allows End Users the ability to view, distribute and store fund related reports.
This Statement of Work covers the design and data architecture for the implementation of each report type as described above; the
design, development of the report preview tool as well as the workflow tool that covers the life cycle of the report production process.  
The Customized Solution was planned by the parties and completed by MOD in phases. An overall project plan, including phases,
milestones and timelines for each phase, was mutually agreed upon between the parties in writing before the project commenced. The
phased project plan was revised upon mutual written agreement between the parties during the coutse’ of the project. Prudential
Retirement provided written business requirements for all deliverables contained in this schedule. MOD.created additional requirements
as needed in order to deliver the Customized Solution for Prudential Retirement. MOD followed,a teview and sign-off process agreed
to by the parties for design, development, testing and implementation of the Customized Solution. This review and sign-off process was
developed and agreed upon between Prudential Retirement and MOD in writing. Additionally; the review and sign-off process was
required for each of the mutually agreed upon project phases. Prudential Retirement provided to MOD a list of authorized parties who
were required to sign-off on all Customized Solution documents including design, development and testing requirements as well as
implementation sign-off and post implementation sign-offs.  
Empower Retirement, LLC, having acquired Prudential Retirement, will be integrating and utilizing the IMDM reporting solution. MOD
will work with Empower to create the solution for Empower’s use, with the following specifications. The majority of data within the IMDM
Reporting Solution for Empower will be provided by Empower, with MOD aeting as Empower’s agent to source certain specific content
sets.  
1.2 Features

repurpose the mapped data sets and modules across report types where possible.
¢* MOD will utilize existing Empower style guides for reports and extend them for report interface features that may not
be included in the style“guides provided.
¢ Empower will provide’data sets to MOD. These data sets will be used by MOD to perform calculations, and the results

a selection of roughly 25 data sets from Morningstar. MOD will also set up, maintain, and integrate into
the Solution new feeds containing Empower fund data from FactSet and State Street Bank. Additional
data sets may be sourced directly by MOD in the future, subject to Amendment to this SOW. Conditions
for the 3 party integrations are listed below; changes to these conditions may impact scope, cost, and
completion timelines.  
. Empower has all necessary 3" party entitlements & agreements in place and that 3"

1.2.4 Changes to Existing Reports — Initial Scope
© The scope of the project includes the following known changes to the existing reports. Additional changes
may occur and will be performed by the MOD team, but will not be considered part of the initial scope and
will not impact completion & acceptance of the Solution.Format, structure, and process for Disclosures, Footnotes and Terms for the various reports
may change based on Empower providing different data to MOD than in the previous system.
= Due Diligence Advisor (“DDA”) reports must be able to run with 2 years of content, for funds
that have less than 3 years of performance data
= Investment Review Report — remove Lipper Benchmark selection from Report Content page
= Investment Analytic Grids — remove Lipper Benchmark selection from Report Content Page
= Investment Review — make the executive summary optional
= For performance calculations, the current process uses the last calendar day (non-business)
of the month if weekend or holiday fell on the month or quarter end date. The change
requested is to change the methodology to use business instead of calendar days.when
calculating performance.  
1.2.5 Report Generation Tool Design and Development  
MOD developed the overall report generation tool and the following key capabilities, which will be made
available to Empower:
¢ Document creation:
= Automatic (Batches): based on a schedule (determined by the control number rules file) the requested
reports will be generated, and loaded into the report library. On creation, 2 versions of the report are
created, one with a watermark that says “Unapproved’\and another version that is exactly the same but
without the watermark. The Unapproved version,will be displayed in the library until it goes through the
workflow process. Once the report is approved)the version without the watermark is displayed and
can be sent to clients.
= Manual (Builder): Reports are generated based on the report type selected, reporting period and criteria
(funds, plans, benchmarks, market segments, etc.). Similar to batch, 2 versions of the report are created
(one with the “Unapproved” watermark and another without) and the Unapproved version will be
displayed in the library until it goes)through the workflow process. Once the report is approved, the
version without the watermark is displayed and can be sent to clients  
1.2.6 Document management
¢ — Allisting of reports will be available through the report library with links for viewing or deleting the reports. Report listing
will be sortable. The report Library willinclude status such as: Pending, Generating, Failed, Unapproved and Approved.
¢ — The Dashboard will allow users/to view reports and move them through the approval workflow. Workflow status on
unapproved reports will include.Draft, Rejected, Reviewing, Reviewing (REG), Approved and Deleted.
= Not all status may be applicable for each reporting deliverable. All reports that have received final
approval will be saved under the "Approved" tab for historical reference.  
= The*reports will remain archived according to Empower’s records retention guidelines. Currently MOD
is storing the reports for the life of the fund/report plus 10 years.  
. If any reports’ cannot be approved based on data discrepancies, Empower will send or cause to be sent a new data
feed. The-iool shows the creation date of the report to allow Empower to see which dated/incorrect data is included in
the"Whapproved" reports. Users can “Re-Run” unapproved reports to include the updated data.  
¢ _Ernpower cannot re-run reports that have been approved. Empower will have to generate a new version with new
data that was fed to MOD. Once the reports are generated, they follow the approval workflow required for that report.

The Customized Solution will provide Empower with the ability to create, maintain, access, track and edit a list of all end users through
a set of workflow files.  
¢ Each end user will have a login created based on such user's level of entitlements. Certain end users will have
different roles (e.g. ISRO — RS, ISRO — IS) for different documents.  
¢ Interface will support three tiers of end users able to view reports; Create, Edit & Approve.
e — End users can change status of reports through the Dashboard.
e — End users with certain access roles will have the ability to edit reports.  
Deleting reports:
¢ Inthe Report library, users can filter to find reports to delete.
¢ — Confirmation notification will appear prompting a user to confirm they want to delete a report.
¢ — There is also the ability to add notes or comments to statuses of reports within the tool for tracking purposes.
e — User cannot Delete Approved reports.  
1.2.6 Report usage
¢ — The system will allow manager to track usage by user:
e What reports were run (via the Dashboard or Library).
e What components were included (via the Library using the edit functionality.report by report).
e What audience was used in creation (via the Library using the edit furictionality report by report with the
exception of Factsheets where this is identified in the name).
¢ Plan Specific or Fund Specific and details (via the Library).
¢ How many were approved (via the Dashboard or Library).
¢ How many remain unapproved (via the Dashboard or Library).
*¢ Batches — how many produced by report type, including audienée, plan/funds scope (via the Pre and Post- batch
files).
¢ How many rejections have occurred (via the Dashboard).
¢ — Allreports that were run for a specific client or by product types (via the Dashboard or Library).  
¢ — Elapsed time from creation through approval, by the different gates and how long each gate is taking; how long
someone took to approve (via the Dashboard by individual report).  
¢ — Who authored, who peer approved; and who did the regulatory approval (via the Dashboard by individual report).  
1.2.7 Content Management System
e Footnotes, Disclosures and Terms:  
¢ MOD will support and host a set of tools for authoring and approving footnotes, disclosures and
terms.  
e Usage:
= How many were approved (via the Dashboard).
= How.many remain unapproved (via the Dashboard).
= How many are ready to expire (via the individual tool).
= ‘How many are related to specific Investment Platform Types (via the induvial tool).  
¢ = DDA Commeniary:
¢ —M@D will support and host a tool for authoring DDA Commentary.  
1.2.8 Tools  
The platforn/will provide a series of tools allowing users to manage the following:
¢ — Performance Calculation Debugging
= Allows users to run performance calculations on Price ID or Benchmark IDs to see Actual and 3-Line
performance for a specific set of dates.
e — Re-Run Performance
= Allows users to enter in a set of Price IDs and have the system generate performance and send it
back to EmpowerUsers can select Price, Benchmark, and GIA performance for a specific set of dates.

processed.  
1.2.9 Changes to Existing Tools
e — Advisor Tool - The code to generate the Advisor Tool will be part of the platform, but will not be updated / tested for this
project and will not go into production. The code and processes / tasks will remain in MOD’s environment for use by
Empower at a future date to be determined, subject to Amendment to this SOW:
= Allows users to see all the plans the system has created Intermediary Reports for. Users can select a plan
and trigger a manual re-run of the underlying reports.  
¢ — Goalmaker Reports — Goalmaker is not in scope for Empower’s use of the Solution and will not be created.  
1.3 Assumptions  
¢ — The data provided by Empower will not be sourced from MOD EDM, thus potentially causing downstream changes that MOD will map
and solve for.  
¢ — Files sent by Empower, including Control Number File for batch generation and Rules Files that govern the Reports business rules, will
be exactly the same as files currently sent by Prudential Retirement, with none to minimal changes-tovalid values. Empower will provide
a data map between the existing files and the new files that will be delivered. Any changes to those files from their current structure, form,
format or content will have additional downstream impact, which may impact completion & delivery.timelines and require MOD to investigate
the scope of the necessary changes. At MOD’s discretion, a separate Amendment to this SOW may be required to incorporate such
changes.  
e¢ MOD will provide timelines for delivery of test files by Empower, and will communicatewith at least one month's notice that delivery date.
Delays in delivery will delay completion timelines.  
¢ — The current logic for all business rules will stay the same. The new Solution will leverage the same Investment Platform Type hierarchy
and Asset Class levels for report generation and footnote/disclosure & terms‘ogic as in the existing platform. If these business rules change
it will have a significant impact on completion timelines.  
¢ — The report generation tool is designed and built for desktop use (not mobile or tablet).
* — Client watchlists, fund scores and client data are not manipulated via MOD systems.  
e — Return inputs required for statistics will be prepared before-delivery to MOD by Empower, with a minimum of daily and monthly
values.  
¢ Empower will deliver all images to be included within feports in proper PDF format.
1.4 Browser Support
MOD will provide support for the Customized Solution inthe following browsers and versions:
¢ — Microsoft Edge
*¢ — Windows/Mac Google Chrome All  
MOD will support the most recent browser versions as they become available. Legacy versions will be retired in due course.
1.5 Accessibility Support
The system creates the Fund Fact Sheet PDF reports that align with WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards that are supported by the Vendor’s PDF  
manipulation tools and have been Accepted by Empower. Additional PDF reports do not adhere to the WCAG 2.0 standards. Empower may
partner with MOD to align additional PDF reports with the WCAG 2.0 standards using an additional SOW.

Monitoring Approach: S&P will choose one or-more pages of the Customized Solution to monitor in order to determine Uptime. Page
selections will be reviewed with the Customer to ensure appropriateness. Each page will be monitored continuously from more than
one location outside of S&P’s network on’a round-robin basis at least once per minute. A page fails a monitoring test if two monitoring
locations fail to access a page in two'successive tries from each monitoring location.  
Uptime Calculation: Uptime willbe calculated at the end of each month based on data provided by S&P’s external monitoring provider.
A page will be considered.tq be unavailable from the time of the first failure until the first subsequent success. All such intervals will be
reviewed and validated by.S&P. Uptime will then be calculated as the sum of all periods during which the page was available during
the calendar month, divided by the total time in the month. One percentage will be calculated per month. Scheduled Maintenance as
described in Section6:4 below shall not be included for purposes of calculating Uptime.
