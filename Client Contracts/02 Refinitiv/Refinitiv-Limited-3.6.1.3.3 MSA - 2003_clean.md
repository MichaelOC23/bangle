(iv)any failure due to any third party telecommunications provider, User’s local
telephone service or User’s Internet service provider, or other force majeure
event;  
(v) Monitored Service Failure due to unavailability of a third party data provider of
Reuters or designated by Reuters;  
(vi) the failure of any third party hardware or software to perform in accordance with
its manufacturer’s specifications, unless the failure was caused by WSOD
negligence, willful misconduct or, failure to maintain and exercise@
maintenance contract on the hardware or software which has failed;  
(vii) connections attempted during Scheduled Outages;  
(viii) connections attempted between 10 PM and 2 AM Eastern Time during

(x) Any Reuters data integrity, entitlement, or data delivery failures.

(i) the total number of minutes within the Available Hours for the month minus
(ii) the total number of minutes of Monitored Service Failure
and the result divided by  
(iii)the total number of minutes within the Available Hours for the month.
To illustrate, in a thirty day month, there are 43,200 minutes during a 30-day month
(assuming all minutes in the month are counted as Available Hours). During this month,
432 minutes having Monitored Service Failures would constitute a 1% loss of Service
Availability; (43,200 - 432)/43,200 = 99% Service Availability.
