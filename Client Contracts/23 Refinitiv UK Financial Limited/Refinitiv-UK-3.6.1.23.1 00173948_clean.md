EXHIBIT A: WORK ORDER #1  
This Work Order #1 incorporates by reference all terms and conditions of the Master Services
Agreement (“Agreement”) between Wall Street On Demand, Inc. (“Provider”) and Thomson
Financial Inc. (“Thomson”) dated February 24, 2005.  
Project Description  
1.1 Provider will design, build and host web-based Standardized Components (as defined in
Section 1.3) that are sold into the financial services market.  
1.2 Provider will provide configurability within the components to accommodate expected client
requests. Should the client require custom work that goes beyond the Standardized: Component
offering, Provider will work with Thomson to jointly meet its needs throughca ‘Customized
Solution. Provider will set the price for Customized Solutions as described in séction 5 below.
1.3 Description of Standardized Components vs. Customized Solution:  
a) Standardized Components: Provider will design, develop and host az initial set of Thomsonbranded web-based components using Thomson content for.Thomson to remarket in the
financial services market. These Standardized Components can be differentiated from a
Customized Solution by the following attributes: they cai be ordered from a catalog and
configured in an order form.  
Expected client — specific configurability requirements will be limited to: 1) style (font and
color), 2) internal navigation among Thomson components, 3) fit within client’s existing
navigation, 4) client-specific disclaimers, 5) selective removal of component sub-sections, 6)
variable widths.  
b) Customized Solution: A Customized Solution refers to any service not fitting the
description of a Standardized Component as described above in Section 1.3a.  
Development Schedule  
The schedule for this project will be mutually determined after receipt of detailed requirements  
from Thomson.  
Redundancy  
The solution described herein will be fully operational in both Provider’s primary Boulder data  
center and its redundant data center in Littleton.  
Reporting  
Thomson will contract with and pay WebTrends to provide reporting for all of the component
sités. Provider will tag appropriate fields within the component code to allow for WebTrends
reporting. Provider will be granted access to the WebTrends reports.  
Service Fee  
5.1 Thomson pays Provider a royalty of 25% on billed revenue for all Standardized Components
for all clients.  
5.2 In a case where Thomson supplies the lead for a custom solution opportunity, Provider will
price Customized Solutions and Thomson receives 25% (and Provider receives 75%) of custom
solution revenue if supplying content or capable of supplying content unless agreed by Thomson

to different terms. When Thomson is not capable of supplying the content for a Thomson
generated Custom Solution lead, (e.g. content not available from Thomson or a project without
content), Provider will pay Thomson or the Thomson sales rep the first month of Provider revenue
in the form of payment agreed to by both parties agreed to by both parties. Thomson has the
option to charge additional fees to those charged by Provider for Customized Solutions if
Thomson supplies the lead for the opportunity.  
5.3 All third party content will be treated as a pass-thru. For Example, if Provider was charging
$75 for its services, Thomson would get $25, and the third party provider would get X. The client
would be billed $100 + X.  
5.4 In a case where Provider supplies the lead for a custom solution opportunity, Provider -will
price Customized Solutions and Thomson receives 25% (and Provider receives 75%)-of
Customized Solution revenue if supplying content .

Provider will need to negotiate with Thomson on the price of the Thomson data. The 25%
royalty for data will not apply unless otherwise agreed to with both parties.  
5.6 Thomson will pay Provider a monthly minimum of $35,000 for 24 consecutive months. This
minimum is only to offset the initial development spend that is assumed by Provider. The
minimum will commence when the components (as listed in Appendix C) pass the Provider
quality assurance process.

6.1 Standardized Components will incorporate only Thomson-supplied data. Any exceptions
which require additional data will be agreed to between both parties.
