Servers and Uptime. MOD shall make available the iOS Charts SDK on its servers. The Uptime for the charting service shall be 99.9%
each calendar month. The “Uptime” percentage shall be calculated by subtracting the total minutes of Downtime during the month from
the total minutes in the month, dividing the difference by the total minutes in the month, and then multiplying the result by 100, as shown
in the following equation:  
(Total minutes in month — total minutes of Downtime in month)
Uptime percentage = -------------------------------------------- 2 nnn 22a annem nn nnn anne nnn nnn
