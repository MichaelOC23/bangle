party notifies the other in writing of its decision not to renew the term

formerly known as Network Operations Center  
- Ongoing data feed support and management for
proprietary Client and third party sources  
- Access to proprietary systems, including Markit’s
proprietary symbol cross-reference system  
Usage tracking and reporting through an online management
interface. The Monthly Service Fee includes up to 20 million
(20,000,000) page views per week. Should Client traffic
exceed 20,000,000 page views per week, the parties shall
mutually agree in writing on a revised fee structure to.account
for increased traffic;  
(2) $168,750 USD/month for the Persistent Team of 10 FTEs to
support new development efforts and maifitenance of existing
sites;  
Markit will invoice Client monthly.  
BMO shall pay Markit for any reimbursable expenses incurred by
Markit that have been agreed*to.in advance between the parties
within thirty (30) days of the date of the relevant invoice from Markit.  
Increase or Decrease in Size of Persistent Team  
Client may elect to increase or decrease the number of resources
on the Persistent Team by providing Markit 60 days’ written notice;
email shall suffice for this purpose.  
Should BMO wish to increase the number of Persistent Team
resources; the fee for incremental Persistent Team members above
the original 10 FTEs shall be $22,500 per FTE per month,
regardless of the number of FTEs.  
Should BMO wish to decrease the number of Persistent Team
resources by a given unit for a resource that has been active for
nine (9) full months or more, this will commensurately reduce fees
for the Persistent Team and not impact fees for Hosting Services.  
10  
Proprietary & Confidential  
For example, the reduction of FTEs by one (1) unit, is equivalent to
10% of the inventory of FTEs referenced at the Effective Date of this
SOW #18. As such, one (1) less FTE would result in updated
monthly fees of $151,875 for the nine (9) remaining FTEs of the
Persistent Team and $56,250 for Hosting Services.  
Should BMO wish to decrease Persistent Team resources by a
given unit for a resource that has been active for less than nine (9)
full months, this will commensurately reduce fees for the Persistent
Team as well as the fees for Hosting Services. For example, the
reduction of FTEs by one (1) unit, is equivalent to 10% of the
inventory of FTEs referenced at the Effective Date of this SOW #18.
As such, one (1) less FTE would result in updated monthly fees of
$151,875 for the nine (9) remaining FTEs of the Persistent Team
and $50,625 for Hosting Services.  
For those projects for which Client does not want to utilize the
Persistent Team, separate SOWs may be.issuéd on a one-time
basis. Continued Hosting Services and maintenance related to such
projects may be governed under the\ierms of this SOW, and this
SOW may be amended to reference‘hewly-launched projects.
