Amendment #1 to Statement of Work #18
Bank of Montreal  
APPENDIX  
Markit Digital recognizes that ESG will play a central role to BMO’s brand and experiences in the future
and, by this amendment, requires an MVP delivered in BMO’s 2022 fiscal year.  
Below are the placeholder modules used by our multi-disciplinary, solution-design committee to estimate
efforts for an MVP that includes the first 1-2 items. While neither the modules in and of themselves nor
their priority are binding at this point, any major shift in requirements, unanticipated iterations or
approval delays may impact our ability to deliver on schedule (on or before October 31, 2022). The list of
initiatives or priorities thereof may be amended from time to time based upon BMO's direction to Markit
and mutually agreed upon by BMO and Markit.
