SCHWAB ECONOMIC MODELING TOOL SPECIFICATIONS  
Specifications and Services  
MOD will perform the following Services in connection with the Schwab Economic Modeling
Tool, which includes the design, development, hosting and maintenance of two websites_\The
websites will host and feature two different versions of tools based on Schwab’s Economic
Model.  
1) The first website will be publicly accessible and will be a basic version of the
Economic Model. This version of the tool will have scaled down functionality as directed
by Schwab, and is intended to give users a high level understanding of what would be
available with the full version of the Economic Modeling Tool.  
2 ) The second website will require a username and passwerd to access and will be
available to Schwab personnel (Business Development Officers (“BDO”), or others as
deemed necessary) and prospective Investment Advisors.  
MOD will work with Schwab to create a web-based’model outlining the costs and benefits
for Investment Advisors looking to start their own firm or to join a firm. The calculations
used to create the model will be based on Schwab’s current model.  
The Economic Modeling Tool created for BDO users and Schwab prospects will have
multiple user tiers with one tier being an,administrator who will be able to manage users.
Both versions of the Economic Modeling tool will accept inputs from users and use those
inputs to create a model specific to that user.  
The Economic Modeling Tool forBDO users will include PDF reporting capabilities based
on the results of the tool and-the users input. The tool will also allow BDOs to save models
and return later to complete/update them as needed.  
Schwab may request updates/changes to the Economic Modeling tool once per quarter.
MOD will perform:sueh requested changes so long as the requests are reasonable and MOD
does not need toiieur significant costs to do so.  
(collectively, the“Business Requirements”). In addition, the Schwab Economic Modeling Tool
will incorporate certain modifications and enhancements at no additional cost as mutually agreed
by the parties.  
The monthly hosting fee will cover site hosting (bandwidth and hardware), technical
infrastructure upgrades and certain requested enhancements of feature development work as
set forth above.  
If Schwab requests material enhancement or maintenance work that requires MOD to incur
additional costs or expenses that are not within the scope of the SOW as contemplated when
creating the SOW, then MOD will provide Schwab with a written good faith assessment of
such costs and expenses and the time required to perform the modifications required, for
Schwab’s consideration. If Schwab accepts the written estimate and agrees to have MOD

An enhanced version of the public version of the Economic Modeling Tool
(Development Phase I) that adds greater customization and more detailed
assumptions that generate comparisons between the RIA, wire house and captive
hybrid models.  
The Economic Modeling Tool (Development Phase II) will also provide a more
in-depth analysis of transition costs, and allow users to over-ride specified fields
in support of specific business case scenarios.  
The Economic Modeling Tool will provide PDF reporting capabilities based on
the results of the Economic Modeling Tool and the users input.
