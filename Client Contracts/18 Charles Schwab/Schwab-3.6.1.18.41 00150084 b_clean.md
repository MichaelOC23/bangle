PAYMENT  
Schwab was obligated under the Letter of Intent to pay WSOD a one hundred thousand dollar
($100,000.00) nonrefundable fee to offset the costs of development of the Custom Alerts
Delivery Systems, 50% of which was to be refundable if the system was not launched as a
Customer pilot. The parties acknowledge that Schwab paid such fee to WSOD in March, 1999  
The monthly fee payable by Schwab for all of WSOD’s services and products under this
Agreement, including but not limited to all data costs, development, implementation; hosting,
maintenance, support, and training in connection with the Custom Site and the Custom Alerts
Delivery Systems from product Jaunch through December 31, 1999, will be $10,000 per month.  
Beginning Ianary 1, 2000, the monthly fee payable hy Schwab for all of WSON’s services and
products under this Agreement, including but not limited to all development, implementation,
hosting, maintenance, support, and training in connection with the-Custom Site and the Custom
Alerts Delivery Systems, will be based on the “Monthly Alerts Volume” for such month,
calculated as follows:  
Total uuube: uf Price and Volume Alerts sent. by WSOD to Schwab customers | the
total number of Earnings Alerts sent to General Investor customers under this Agreement
during such month.  
Fees for all other messages sent to signature services customers are paid under separate contracts
and by separate groups in Schwab. Thenumber of Price and Volume messages sent to signature
services customers will not be included in any other monthly fee calculations for other Schwab —  
WSOD contracts.  
The monthly fee will be payable as follows:  
Monthly Alerts Volume Monthly Fee  
1-3,000,000 $40,000  
3,000,001 -4,000,000 $45,000  
4,000,001-5,500,000 $50,000  
5,500,001 6,000;000 $60,000  
6,000,001 or greater $60,000 + $.01/message for each  
message after the 6millionth message  
When the Average Daily Alerts Volume for a month exceeds one million (1,000,000), fees for
such excess messages will be negoUated by the parties in good faith.  
These will be no charge to Schwab for incremental hardware costs incurred as a result of user
increase of the number of Custom Alerts. Development costs for additional enhancements to the
Custom Alerts Delivery Systems are included in the monthly fees outlined above.
