Hi Kiko,  
| spoke to Sarah and she stated that we will drop this monthly cost due to;  
= Previous to the decision to phase out the project we would charge them this cost due to us host two sites in
production. Since we are phasing out the site we are no longer hosting two complete research'sites in parallel.
= It was a WSOD initiative to phase out the project.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you! Have a great day!
